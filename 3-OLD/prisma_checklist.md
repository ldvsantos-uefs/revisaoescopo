JBI = Joanna Briggs Institute; PRISMA-ScR = Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews.

\* Where *sources of evidence* (see second footnote) are compiled from,
such as bibliographic databases, social media platforms, and Web sites.

† A more inclusive/heterogeneous term used to account for the different
types of evidence or data sources (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative
research, expert opinion, and policy documents) that may be eligible in
a scoping review as opposed to only studies. This is not to be confused
with *information sources* (see first footnote).

‡ The frameworks by Arksey and O'Malley (6) and Levac and colleagues (7)
and the JBI guidance (4, 5) refer to the process of data extraction in a
scoping review as data charting*.*

§ The process of systematically examining research evidence to assess
its validity, results, and relevance before using it to inform a
decision. This term is used for items 12 and 19 instead of \"risk of
bias\" (which is more applicable to systematic reviews of interventions)
to include and acknowledge the various sources of evidence that may be
used in a scoping review (e.g., quantitative and/or qualitative
research, expert opinion, and policy document).
