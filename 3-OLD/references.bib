@article{Cordero2018,
   abstract = { The Nilgiri Hills in the Western Ghats of India constitute a region of high biological and cultural diversity, and include an endangered shola forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem. A mosaic ecosystem is one consisting of adjacent, coexisting patches of highly distinct naturally occurring land states (in this case, shola forest and natural grassland). Changes in the landscape since the nineteenth century have severely impacted the shola-grassland mosaic and challenged the traditional lifestyles of the indigenous Toda people. However, the responses of traditional Toda socio-ecological perspectives and landscape management to these changes have not been explored through population surveys. Here, using a survey method, the article explores traditional Toda perspectives of ecosystem value and landmanagement practices. The survey consists of interviews of 50 respondents belonging to 24 munds (villages), covering ten clans, neighbouring mosaic lands, plantations and agricultural areas. The findings show that traditional socio-ecological landscape management is robust and has persisted despite marked ecological and socio-economic changes during the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, and despite frequent gathering of land management advice from non-Toda. Elements of traditional socio-ecological knowledge that have persisted include prevalent collective traditional decision-making and long-held preferences for a landscape composition with a strong mosaic component. The highly robust nature of Toda socio-ecological culture and land management suggests that the Todas have a valuable role to play in supporting the long-term persistence of the shola-grassland mosaic. Increasing their stewardship role would help conserve this endangered and highly biodiverse ecosystem, while at the same time preserving a unique indigenous culture. },

@article{Akanmu2023,
   abstract = {Attaining sufficiency in food supply to support a growing population without compromising ecosystem functioning remains a top agenda of researchers and agricultural stakeholders. Agroecological farming approaches are effective techniques that ensure sustainable food production even in adverse situations. Population growth has been forecasted to reach over 9.1 billion by 2050 outpacing food production. However, cereals and grain legumes are strategic to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030 (SDG 2), ending extreme poverty (SDG 1), and mitigating the climate change effect (SDG 13). There remains an urgent need to embrace more sustainable measures to increase food production for the growing population. This review explores the role of agroecology which employs a transdisciplinary approach to sustainable agricultural practices to improve the resilience of farming systems by increasing diversification through poly-cropping, agroforestry, use of local varieties, and integrated crop and livestock systems. Furthermore, the agroecological farming approach minimizes water use, lowers pollution levels on the farm, and ensures economic profitability for the farmers. Thus, application of agroecology techniques among the smallholder farmers is strategic to ensuring food security.},

   abstract = {Individual agroecological farms can act as lighthouses to amplify the uptake of agroecological principles and practices by other farmers. Amplification is critical for the upscaling of agroecological production and socio-political projects emphasizing farmer sovereignty and solidarity. However, territories are contested spaces with historical, social, cultural, and economic contexts that can present challenges to the effectiveness of farmer lighthouses in catalyzing localized agrarian change. We explore these amplification dynamics through fieldwork in a particular region of Japan employing interviews and data derived from an assessment of nine farms using ten amplification indicators. The indicators include social organization, participation in networks, community leadership, and degrees of dependency on policies or markets among others, as well as degree of adoption of on-farm agroecological practices, all of which capture farmer lighthouses' potential to amplify territorial upscaling. At the same time, we trace the historical development of a previous generation of Japanese farmer lighthouses practicing organic agriculture in alignment with agroecological principles that experienced, to varying degrees, push-back, co-option, and successful territorialization in rural communities. We find that many of the same social and cultural territorial dynamics are still influential today and affecting the amplifying effect of agroecological farmer lighthouses, but also find examples of new clustering around lighthouses that take advantage of both the historical vestiges of the previous generation's efforts as well as contemporary shifts in practice and agrarian orientation. This research calls for a detailed dissection of the dynamic and contrasting processes of agroecological territorialization and the ways in which diverse contexts shape agroecological upscaling.},

Data collection used in-depth interviews and participatory observation with a number of coffee farmers. Data analysis was conducted thematically to identify the main patterns, key findings, and perspectives that emerged from participants' narratives. The results of this studi showed that the types of cultural capital owned by Pandalungan coffee farmers include traditional knowledge, local agricultural practices, community values, and social norms that support food security. The Coffee farmers in Pandalungan have in-depth knowledge of traditional farming practices passed down through generations. This knowledge includes specific techniques in planting, tending and harvesting coffee that are adapted to local conditions. In addition, the cultural capital of Pandalungan coffee farmers plays a crucial role in supporting sustainable food security.},

sample size consisted of 162 respondents who were working as field
extension functionaries, academicians and agro-based entrepreneurs
across the country. The study revealed that the most of respondents
(42.59\%) belonged to middle age group (36-50 years) followed by young
age group (upto 35 years). Half of respondents had working experience of
11-20 years. Commercial dairy fainting (59.88\%) under production
domain, preparation of value added milk and milk products (59.88\%)
under processing domain and establishment of milk parlour in urban areas
(77.16\%) under marketing domain were perceived by respondents as
potential areas for entrepreneurship in dairying. The respondents
considered low level of education/knowledge (58.64\%), lack of family
and financial support (56.79\%) and household responsibility (30.25\%)
as hurdles for participation of women in entrepreneurship. They opined
that better remunerative prices (30.86\%), government support (28.39\%)
and providing education and need-based training (25.31\%) could motivate
women to take up entrepreneurship. They suggested that providing
education and training (47.53\%), awareness through exposure visits and
motivation camps (42.59\%) and development of market facilities/linkages
(24.07\%) would be effective strategies to motivate youth and women in
agro-based entrepreneurship. Support systems like creating awareness
among women about available opportunities (35.18\%) and formation of
self help groups (29.63\%) along with providing subsidies and incentives
(45.68\%) would strengthen the hands of women for venturing into
agri-business. The study concluded that dairying has very large scope
(54.94\%) for women-led entrepreneurship if provided with proper hand
holding support, training and motivation.},

We contend that to succeed in this endeavor, it is crucial to link biocultural revitalization to conservation practice. Our hope with this review is to call attention to indigenous storytelling as an option worth adding to the repertoire of conservation practitioners who aim to: (1) link conservation actions to indigenous worldviews; (2) foster connections between indigenous peoples and their landscapes; (3) facilitate intergenerational transfer of indigenous knowledge; (4) support dialogue over conservation; and (5) promote local participation in conservation. Because indigenous stories are full of resonance, memory, and wisdom'in a footing that is structurally free of power imbalance between conservation practitioners and local communities', we contend that they can be crucial to guide future efforts in biocultural conservation practice. Our review shows that deeper consideration and promotion of indigenous storytelling can lead to enhanced understanding of diverse values and perceptions around biodiversity, while offering a constructive approach for greater inclusion of indigenous peoples in conservation pursuits.},

Before bypass, pulmonary removal was 85.7 +/- 1.2% (means +/- SE, n = 18) and was unchanged on restoration of normal circulation after 1'2 h of CPB (80.6 +/- 1.8%, n = 7) or 3 h of LHB (87.4 +/- 1.6%, n = 4). However, on restoration of normal pulmonary arterial blood flow after 3 h of CPB, removal was significantly decreased to 74.5 +/- 2.2% (P less than 0.01, n = 7). Postbypass depression of [3H]PGE1 removal may explain our previous observations that intrabypass elevations in endogenous immunoreactive prostaglandin E in dogs were not entirely reversible on cessation of 3'4 h of CPB. Possible factors underlying depression of post-CPB pulmonary removal of [3H]PGE1 include: 1) local saturation of [3H]PGE1 removal secondary to intrapulmonary or intravascular release of prostaglandin E, 2) inhibition of prostaglandin dehydrogenase activity, or 3) damage to endothelial cell transport of [3H]PGE1 from the pulmonary microcirculation.},

More specifically, since there is still insufficient access to vaccines and no straightforward, reliable treatment for COVID-19, every country has taken the appropriate precautions (such as physical separation, masking, and lockdown) to combat this extremely infectious disease. As a result, people invest much time on online social networking platforms (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Twitter) and express their feelings and thoughts regarding COVID-19. Twitter is a popular social networking platform, and it enables anyone to use tweets. This research used Twitter datasets to explore user sentiment from the COVID-19 perspective. We used a dataset of COVID-19 Twitter posts from nine states in the United States for fifteen days (from 1 April 2020, to 15 April 2020) to analyze user sentiment. We focus on exploiting machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches to classify user sentiments regarding COVID-19. First, we labeled the dataset into three groups based on the sentiment values, namely positive, negative, and neutral, to train some popular ML algorithms and DL models to predict the user concern label on COVID-19. Additionally, we have compared traditional bag-of-words and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for representing the text to numeric vectors in ML techniques. Furthermore, we have contrasted the encoding methodology and various word embedding schemes, such as the word to vector (Word2Vec) and global vectors for word representation (GloVe) versions, with three sets of dimensions (100, 200, and 300) for representing the text to numeric vectors for DL approaches. Finally, we compared COVID-19 infection cases and COVID-19-related tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Sentiment analysis (SA) detects people's opinions from text engaging natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Recent research has shown that deep learning models, i.e., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer-based provide promising results for recognizing sentiment. Nonetheless, CNN has the advantage of extracting high-level features by using convolutional and max-pooling layers; it cannot efficiently learn a sequence of correlations. At the same time, Bidirectional RNN uses two RNN directions to improve extracting long-term dependencies. However, it cannot extract local features in parallel, and Transformer-based like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) are the computational resources needed to fine-tune, facing an overfitting problem on small datasets. This paper proposes a novel attention-based model that utilizes CNNs with LSTM (named ACL-SA). First, it applies a preprocessor to enhance the data quality and employ term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) feature weighting and pre-trained Glove word embedding approaches to extract meaningful information from textual data. In addition, it utilizes CNN's max-pooling to extract contextual features and reduce feature dimensionality. Moreover, it uses an integrated bidirectional LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. Furthermore, it applies the attention mechanism at the CNN's output layer to emphasize each word's attention level. To avoid overfitting, the Guasiannoise and GuasianDroupout are adopted as regularization. The model's robustness is evaluated on four English standard datasets, i.e., Sentiment140, US-airline, Sentiment140-MV, SA4A with various performance matrices, and compared efficiency with existing baseline models and approaches. The experiment results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models.},

   abstract = {As the socio-economic landscape expands and tourism flourishes, the traditional earthen dwellings of Tuyugou Village, Turpan, Xinjiang, face significant challenges, including low energy efficiency and suboptimal living comfort, necessitating data-driven and scientifically robust renovation strategies. Existing renovation methods, however, often lack empirical support and rely heavily on the subjective judgments of architects, thus hindering the effective preservation and transmission of cultural heritage. This research addresses the renovation of these traditional dwellings by employing the AHP method to systematically evaluate user requirements, with input from diverse stakeholders, including homeowners, tourists, experts, and government authorities. The study then applies the QFD method to construct the House of Quality, translating user needs into specific design attributes; this is followed by a comprehensive quantitative analysis for optimization. A novel multi-objective optimization model (MOP) is introduced, with materials as the central focus, addressing key aspects of engineering, culture, and energy conservation. The NSGA-II algorithm is utilized to generate optimal Pareto solutions, which are then further refined using the entropy-weighted VIKOR method. Among the ten pre-selected renovation solutions, the sixth design plan was identified as the optimal choice, excelling in cost control, cultural integration, and energy performance. Specifically, it achieved a unit construction cost of RMB 340.566/m2, a cultural adaptability score of 1.5364, and an energy cost of RMB 352.793/kWh, thereby demonstrating an effective balance between traditional architectural elements and modern requirements. The objective decision making enabled by the VIKOR method successfully balances cultural preservation with contemporary needs, enhancing both living standards and tourism appeal. This study offers innovative and empirically grounded renovation strategies for traditional dwellings in arid and semi-arid climates, providing a framework that effectively balances cultural preservation and modernization.},

In this study, three machine learning algorithms Random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and random forest-extreme gradient boosting (XGB-RF) were developed to predict the water distribution uniformity based on operating pressure, heights of sprinkler, discharge, nozzle diameter, wind speed, humidity, highest and lowest temperature for three different impact sprinklers (KA-4, FOX and 2520) for square and triangular system layout based on four scenarios (input combinations). The main findings were; the highest CU value was 86.7% in the square system of 2520 sprinkler under 200'kPa, 0.5'm height and 0.855'm 3 /h (Nozzle 2.5'mm). Meanwhile, in the triangular system, it was 87.3% under the same pressure and discharge and 1'm height. For applied machine learning, the highest values of R 2 were 0.796, 0.825 and 0.929 in RF, XGB and XGB-RF respectively in the first scenario for CU. Moreover, for the DU, the highest values of R 2 were 0.701, 0.479 and 0.826 in RF, XGB and XGB-RF respectively in the first scenario. The obtained results revealed that the sprinkler height had the lowest impact on modeling of the water distribution uniformity. },

   abstract = {<p> The environmental crises currently gripping the Earth have been codified in a new proposed geological epoch: the Anthropocene. This epoch, according to the Anthropocene Working Group, began in the mid-20th century and reflects the 'great acceleration' that began with industrialization in Europe [J. Zalasiewicz et al., <italic>Anthropocene</italic> 19, 55'60 (2017)]. Ironically, European ideals of protecting a pristine 'wilderness,' free from the damaging role of humans, is still often heralded as the antidote to this human-induced crisis [J. E. M. Watson et al., <italic>Nature</italic> , 563, 27'30 (2018)]. Despite decades of critical engagement by Indigenous and non-Indigenous observers, large international nongovernmental organizations, philanthropists, global institutions, and nation-states continue to uphold the notion of pristine landscapes as wilderness in conservation ideals and practices. In doing so, dominant global conservation policy and public perceptions still fail to recognize that Indigenous and local peoples have long valued, used, and shaped 'high-value' biodiverse landscapes. Moreover, the exclusion of people from many of these places under the guise of wilderness protection has degraded their ecological condition and is hastening the demise of a number of highly valued systems. Rather than denying Indigenous and local peoples' agency, access rights, and knowledge in conserving their territories, we draw upon a series of case studies to argue that wilderness is an inappropriate and dehumanizing construct, and that Indigenous and community conservation areas must be legally recognized and supported to enable socially just, empowering, and sustainable conservation across scale. </p>},

   abstract = {<p>Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) have inhabited coastal areas, the seas, and remote islands for millennia, and developed place-based traditional ancestral knowledge and diversified livelihoods associated with the biocultural use of marine and coastal ecosystems. Through their cultural traditions, customary wise practices, and holistic approaches to observe, monitor, understand, and appreciate the Natural World, IPLCs have been preserving, managing, and sustainably using seascapes and coastal landscapes, which has been essential for biodiversity conservation. The international community has more than ever recognized the central role of IPLCs in the conservation of biodiversity-rich ecosystems, in particular, for the achievement of the Global Biodiversity Targets determined by the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity to tackle biodiversity loss. However, much remains to be done to fully recognize and protect at national levels IPLCs' Traditional Biodiversity Knowledge (TBK), ways of life, and their internationally recognized rights to inhabit, own, manage and govern traditional lands, territories, and waters, which are increasingly threatened. At the 2018 4th World Conference on Marine Biodiversity held in Montraal, Canada, eight themed working groups critically discussed progress to date and barriers that have prevented the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets agreed for the period 2011'2020, and priority actions for the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Discussions in the 'Application of Biodiversity Knowledge' working group focused on Targets 11 and 18 and the equal valuation of diverse Biodiversity Knowledge Systems (BKS). This Perspective Paper summarizes the 10 Priority Actions identified for a holistic biodiversity conservation, gender equality and human rights-based approach that strengthens the role of IPLCs as biodiversity conservation decision-makers and managers at national and international levels. Furthermore, the Perspective proposes a measurable Target 18 post-2020 and discusses actions to advance the recognition of community-based alternative conservation schemes and TBK to ensure the long-lasting conservation, customary biocultural use, and sustainable multi-functional management of nature around the globe.</p>},

The study area is inserted in a wide rural landscape, still retaining a high degree of naturalness and is studied for the first time from an ethnobotanical point of view. By analyzing local traditional uses of wild plants in the Ansanto Valley area, the present study aims to contribute to the implementation of ethnobotanical knowledge concerning southern Italy. To gather ethnobotanical knowledge related to the Ansanto Valley, 69 semi-structured interviews were carried out through a snowball sampling approach, starting from locals with experience in traditional plant uses (key informants). A number of 117 plant species (96 genera and 46 families) were documented for traditional use from a total of 928 reports, of which 544 were about medicinal plants. New use reports on the utilization of plants for medicinal (5) and veterinary applications (8) in the Campania region and the whole Italian territory were outlined from our investigations. Sedum cepaea is reported as a medicinal plant for the first time in Italy and in the whole Mediterranean basin.},

   abstract = {Indigenous cultural practices play a significant role in the conservation of forests. Most of the forests within traditional communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana were preserved centuries ago through traditional beliefs and practices. Yet, less attention has been given to them in modern forest management. In most communities, these traditional practices are gradually 'dying out.' This work identified cultural practices that have been used to successfully conserve forests by four communities purposively selected from the Ashanti region of Ghana (i.e., Semanhyiakrom, Akegyesu, Kubease, and Jachie), their benefits, and the perceived reasons for their neglect in the management of public forests. Qualitative data were collected through semistructured interviews using stratified random sampling technique to select respondents. The study found that beliefs, taboos, myths, proverbs, and songs were vital traditional systems used by the Ashantis to effectively conserve their forests. The Ashantis believe that the neglect of cultural practices in the management of public forests has resulted in increasing rate of deforestation, destruction of water bodies, and disasters inflicted by the gods such as prolonged drought and loss of soil fertility. To avoid forest degradation, it is important for forest managers, decision makers, and governments to recognize various cultural practices and traditional beliefs as very useful tools and integrate them into current national and international forestry plans and programs.},

   abstract = {The topic of 'illegal' settlements cannot be separated from the topic of agrarian tenure, specifically the tenure of land, water, plants, and mining resources. In the development of a capitalistic city, the emergence of settlements through informal land tenure is inevitable due to the inability of the marginalized community to afford the high price of land. Presidential Regulation Number 86 of 2018 regarding Agrarian Reform at first glance looks like fresh air for the urban marginalized communities who have difficulties having asset and access to argarian resources. However, cities in Indonesia have diverse dynamics due to different backgrounds and also due to urbanization, therefore various alternatives are required in the implementation process. One of the Government's instruments in implementing the agrarian reform mandate to distribute land rights to the people is Land Consolidation, espescially Vertical Land Consolidation in Jakarta due to limited of coverage area. An alternative is needed to ensure that the right to a decent standard of living is fulfilled without making marginal communities merely objects of planning but also subjects of planning.},

We propose a holistic conceptual framework of preconditions including sovereignty, the North American Model management, funding, cultural resources, stakeholder support, and programmatic leadership. We assess the current status and common challenges with each precondition and illustrate their potential roles for a more lasting and pervasive integration of IK into tribal wildlife management programs.},

Our review also provides examples of how Indigenous and Local Knowledge can be incorporated in the planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration activities. However, not all restoration initiatives engaging IPLC are beneficial or successful, and the factors that lead to success are not fully known. While local involvement in restoration projects is often mentioned as an element of success, this is primarily associated to projects that actively involve IPLC in codesigning restoration activities affecting their territories, ensure both short-term direct benefits to IPLC and long-term support of the maintenance of restored areas, and recognize IPLC local traditions and customary institutions. Based on these examples, we argue that IPLC should be a more important focus in any post-2020 CBD agenda on restoration.},

Among the coastal Amis people, freediving spearfishing is not only a way of life but is also closely related to ritual ceremonies. Amis spearfishing men are knowledgeable of the near-shore sea and coast, and the practice of spearfishing collectively cultivates their ability to deal with both public affairs and human relations in the community. However, the Taiwanese government regards spearfishing guns as weapons and restricts them. Furthermore, the assumption that spearfishing destroys the coral ecosystem and fishery resources means that the practice is often demonized or increasingly restrained. In this paper, I argue that local marine Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) among Amis spearfishing men can be the foundation for local marine conservation under the concept of community-based natural-resource management (CBNRM), involving both the local Amis community and the government, in spite of both parties still having their own issues to overcome.},

A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords' combinations of 'machine learning' along with 'crop management', 'water management', 'soil management', and 'livestock management', and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018'2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.},

Here we consider a network of 788 forest protected areas (PAs) in the world's largest tropical country to examine the degree to which they remain intact, and their responses to multiple biophysical and socioeconomic variables potentially affecting natural habitat loss under varying contexts of rural development. PAs within the complex Brazilian National System of Conservation Units (SNUC) are broken down into two main classes'strictly protected and sustainable use. Collectively, these account for 22.6% of the forest biomes within Brazil's national territory, primarily within the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest, but are widely variable in size, ecoregional representation, management strategy, and the degree to which they are threatened by human activities both within and outside reserve boundaries. In particular, we examine the variation in habitat conversion rates in both strictly protected and sustainable use reserves as a function of the internal and external human population density, and levels of land-use revenue in adjacent human-dominated landscapes. Our results show that PAs surrounded by heavily settled agro-pastoral landscapes face much greater challenges in retaining their natural vegetation, and that strictly protected areas are considerably less degraded than sustainable use reserves, which can rival levels of habitat degradation within adjacent 10-km buffer areas outside.},

   abstract = {Indigenous peoples are groups with different cultural and social characteristics that share inherited ties to their homeland and natural resources. They have their own understanding and cultural experience that amounts to traditional ecological knowledge. The aim of this study is to identify the impacts of traditional ecological knowledge on indigenous people. Two main databases, namely Web of Science and Scopus, were used to conduct a systematic literature review. From the findings and analysis, two themes and eleven sub-themes were identified. The first theme is economic activities, including six sub-themes: sources of income, employment opportunities, offering products to vendors or buyers, providing market value, providing low treatment cost, and providing opportunities to develop micro-enterprises. The second theme is health, with five sub-themes: supporting food security, harvesting country food, food or plant benefits, perceived health or medicinal purposes, and livelihoods of the indigenous people. In conclusion, traditional knowledge can play an important role in contributing to the livelihoods of indigenous people. In general, traditional knowledge can help indigenous people to improve their quality of life, especially those who rely on natural resources to survive, by offering secure and supplemented food, for instance, as well as a source of earnings, crucial for food security during hard times. Additionally, traditional knowledge of wild edible and medicinal plants can play a significant role in a community's capacity to remain resilient and be preserved for future generations.},

Creole seeds are the of an ecology of practices and knowledge, and they are configured as new subjects of law for allowing the patrimonial identities reproduction. Through creole seeds, an ecology of socio-territorial knowledge and practices are engendered, enabling communities to manage their identities in networks of actors who seek to build socio-territorial reproduction strategies that are an alternative to rural development. In this context, the formation of a Creole Seek Bank represents a new collective strategy for the agrobiodiversity revaluation, as they organize and connect efforts to territorialize this heritage knowledge materialized in varieties' of corn, rice, beans, pumpkins, spices and native trees. In the territorialities configuration of the coexistence of Latin American rural communities, we must highlight mainly the hybridization of nature practices of the indigenous populations, as well as the' Portuguese and Spanish colonial process, because all inheritances are re-signified in face of the multiple modalities that territorialize and cross rural communities.},

   abstract = {Aristolochia clematitis L. is a perennial herbaceous plant distributed throughout Europe, Asia Minor and Caucasus. It has been used as a medicinal plant since antiquity but not in recent times because it contains poisonous aristolochic acid, causing progressive kidney failure. The aim of this work was to study Aristolochia clematitis ecology on the basis of vegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, and to investigate the differentiation of its ecological niche using a co-occurrence-based measure of ecological specialization (ESI). The ecological niche was studied on three spatial scales: on the entire distribution area, its differentiation across 200 a 200 km grid cells and the differences between three central and three marginal regions. Our results suggest that Aristolochia clematitis has a very broad ecological niche occurring in a range of different habitats and climatic conditions, with a trend of a niche width decrease with the distance from the geographical center. The plant prefers more stable communities with less anthropogenic influence moving towards the margin of the distribution area. Specialization towards the marginal area is a result of evolutionary history, which refers to the recent anthropogenically induced spread from its original home range. A high incidence of Aristolochia clematitis in the vegetation of arable lands and market gardens as well as anthropogenic herbaceous vegetation in the distribution center corresponds to the geographical incidence of Balkan Endemic Nephropathy.},

The study documents their traditional knowledge of the use of plant species for medicinal and culinary purposes. A total of 87 plant species from 41 different families were cataloged, with the Asteraceae family (15 species) and the Lamiaceae family (12 species) being the most commonly used. These plants were found to be used to treat 20 different ailments, with menstrual cramps being the most common (12 species). The fidelity values for these plants ranged from 11.10 to 71.42, demonstrating their importance in traditional medicine. In addition, 17 plant species were found to be useful for gastronomic purposes, with Juglans regia being the most valuable (use value of 0.73). The study also evaluated the conservation status of these plants and found that seven of them are considered critically endangered, ten endangered, and four endangered according to the IUCN classification. This study offers insights into the Dard people's deep connection to their natural environment and has significant implications for policy formulation, cultural conservation, and sustainable use of endemic species, as well as potential applications in pharmaceutical research for therapeutic compounds.},

   abstract = {The Rural development as a strategic direction economic regional policy, assumes the effective functioning of the branches of the agro-industrial complex, designed to provide the processing industry with raw materials, and, ultimately, with high-quality food for the population. Stimulating investments in the development of promising areas of the agro-industrial complex will satisfy the demand for agricultural products at affordable prices, increase the level of investment attractiveness of agricultural sectors; the level of employment of the rural population and the development of small forms of farming. The economic system of the region is a complex of interrelated and interdependent elements that are exposed to external and internal factors and are largely determined by the resource potential of the region. At the same time, the issues of self-sufficient development of regions do not lose their relevance},
