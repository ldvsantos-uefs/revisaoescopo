Title = {Stepwise strategy based on untargeted metabolomic 1H NMR fingerprinting
   and pattern recognition for the geographical authentication of virgin
   olive oils},

Abstract = {1H NMR fingerprinting of virgin olive oils (VOOs) and a collection of
   binary classification models arranged in a decision tree are presented
   as a stepwise strategy to determine the geographical origin of a VOO at
   four levels, i.e. provenance from an EU member state or outside the EU,
   country and region of origin, and compliance with a geographical
   indication scheme. This approach supports current EU regulation that
   makes labelling of the geographical origin mandatory for olive oil.
   Currently, official methods for its control are still lacking. Partial
   least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest for
   classification afforded robust and stable binary classification models
   to verify the geographical origin of VOOs; however, the former
   outperformed the latter in terms of accuracy and robustness. The
   prediction abilities of the best binary PLS-DA model for each case study
   were between 80\% and 100\% for both classes in cross-validation and in
   external validation. The satisfactory results achieved for the
   verification of the geographical origin of VOOs, together with those of
   our previous studies on the discrimination of olive oil categories, the
   detection of olive oils blended with vegetable oils (Alonso-Salces et
   al., 2022), and the determination of the stability, freshness, storage
   time and conditions, and olive oil best-before date (Alonso-Salces et
   al., 2021), confirm that a single 1H NMR analysis of an olive oil sample
   can provide useful information to control several EU regulations related
   to olive oil marketing standards (Regulation (EU) 2022/2104 and
   Regulation (EU) 2024/1143).},

Abstract = {Zhejiang Suichang native honey, which is included in the list of China's
   National Geographical Indication Agricultural Products Protection
   Project, is very popular. This study proposes a method of Raman
   spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms to accurately
   detect low-concentration adulterated Suichang native honey. In this
   study, the native honey collected by local beekeepers in Suichang was
   selected for adulteration detection. The spectral data was compressed by
   Savitzky-Golay smoothing and partial least squares (PLS) in sequence.
   The PLS features taken for further analysis were selected according to
   the contribution rate. In this study, three classification modeling
   methods including support vector machine, probabilistic neural network
   and convolutional neural network were adopted to correctly classify pure
   and adulterated honey samples. The total accuracy was 100\%, 100\% and
   99.75\% respectively. The research result shows that Raman spectroscopy
   combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential in
   accurately detecting adulteration of low-concentration honey.},

Abstract = {An electronic nose and an electronic tongue, in combination with
   multivariate analysis, have been used to verify the geographical origin
   and the uniqueness of specific extra virgin olive oils. The olive oil
   samples belong to a small production, located in the lake of Garda
   (north of Italy) and distinguished with a European Protected
   Denomination of Origin trademark since 1998. In order to obtain a
   complete description of oil samples, free acidity, peroxide value,
   ultraviolet indices, and phenol content have been also determined. The
   dataset includes 36 Garda oils and 17 oils from other regions. Two
   classification models have been built by means of Counterpropagation
   Artificial Neural Networks in order to separate Garda and not-Garda
   oils, as follows: first, by using all the chemical variables and sensor
   signals; second, by using electronic tongue sensors; finally, by using
   four selected electronic nose sensors. All the models have been also
   tested with 19 commercial olive oil samples. Neural networks have
   provided very satisfactory results and have indicated the electronic
   nose as the most appropriate tool for the characterization of the
   analyzed oils. These results have suggested how electronic nose, in
   combination with neural networks, could represent a fast, cheap and
   functional method to classify and describe extra virgin olive oils from
   a circumscribed geographical area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Discriminative Study on Huzhu Qingke Liquor by Back Propagation Neural
   Network Combined With Ultraviolet-Near Infrared Fusion Spectroscopy},
Journal = {SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Chinese Huzhu Qingke Liquor is a protected geographical indication
   product, and it is of great significance for its accurate evaluation and
   classification. Due to the advantages of ultraviolet (UV) and
   near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, such as fast, accurate,
   non-destructive detection and no sample pretreatment, are widely used in
   food and other fields. In this study, a fast, nondestructive, and
   efficient discriminative classification model for Huzhu Qingke Liquor
   was established based on UV, NIR, and UV-NIR intermediate data fusion
   spectroscopy (UV-NIR) combined with theback-propagation neural network
   (BPNN) method. Since the unoptimized spectra are affected by noise and
   baseline drift due to the superimposed interference of spectral
   eigenpeaks, the spectra are denoised using four preprocessing methods,
   namely, standard normal variable transform (SNV), Savitzky-Golay
   smoothing (SG), first-order derivative (1D) and second-order derivative
   (2D). Further, relative to a single spectrum, the fused spectrum can
   complement the diversified spectroscopic information and improve the
   performance of the classification model, so the feature variables are
   selected by five variable screening methods, namely, competitive
   adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), successive projection algorithm
   (SPA), principal component analysis (PCA), variable projection
   importance analysis (VIP), and variable combinatorial clustering
   analysis (VCPA) to achieve the optimization of model performance and the
   purpose of fusing the effective information of two spectra. Finally, the
   best method for establishing the BPNN model for single and fused spectra
   was selected. The results show that the classification model established
   by selecting 30 feature variables by SPA after SNV preprocessing for UV
   spectra has the best recognition effect, with a classification accuracy
   of 100\%. The MSE value, R-p(2), R (Train), R (Validation), R (Test) and
   R (All) were 0.018 0, 1, 0.928 3, 0.958 7, 0.913 0, and 0.929 7,
   respectively; PCA selected the NIR and UV-NIR after SG preprocessing
   with 84 and 106 The classification model built by feature variables had
   the best recognition effect, and the NIR spectral classification
   accuracy was 100\%, with MSE value, R-p(2), R (Train), R (Validation), R
   (Test) and R (All) of 0, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000 and 1.000.
   respectively, UV-NIR spectral classification accuracy was 100\%, MSE,
   R-p(2), R (Train), R (Validation), R (Test), and R (All) were 0.005 7,
   1.000, 1.000, 0.987 1, 0.991 3 and 0.996 4, respectively; the fusion
   spectra can significantly improve the predictive ability and robustness
   of the classification model compared with the single-spectrum modeling,
   thus realizing the rapid and non-destructive analysis of Huzhu Qingke
   Liquor.},

   63.8\%, 12.1\%, and 65.2\% for the samples out of targeted geographical
   origins, respectively. By contrast, the one-class classification models
   could completely differentiate Changshan from non-Changshan camellia
   oils, even from the adjacent counties. Moreover, compared with
   traditional indicators of mineral elements, the model built by fatty
   acid profiles possessed higher sensitivity and specificity. It also
   offered a reference strategy for the geographical origin identification
   of other high-value oils or foods.},

Title = {The analysis of volatile compounds through flavoromics and machine

   paste from different regions},

Abstract = {Traditional Chinese fermented shrimp paste is a national geographical
   indication product with a distinctly regional flavor. The great
   commercial value and highly appreciated aroma urgently require
   establishing reliable methods to define the origin of shrimp paste and
   dissect the aroma essence. Therefore, in this study, flavoromics,
   chemometrics, and data augmented machine learning were performed to
   analyze shrimp paste from different regions of Bohai Bay, China. The
   results showed that shrimp paste contained several volatile compounds,
   including sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds,
   aldehydes, and alcohols. In addition, chemometric and flavor association
   networks indicated that higher salt content produces some volatile
   compounds, such as 2-heptanone and phenylethanol. Furthermore, the
   prominent fruitiness and fermented aromas were associated with some key
   aroma substances, such as (E)-2-octenal and phenylethanol. Finally, a
   classification model for the origin identification of shrimp paste was
   developed. The results showed that seven trained machine learning
   models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
   artificial neural network (ANN), were able to accurately (100\%)
   identify the origin of shrimp paste. In summary, this study provides a
   theoretical support and application basis for identifying the origin and
   protection of the characteristic geographical flavor of shrimp paste.},

   Spectroscopy for Quality Control},
Journal = {HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Saffron, obtained by dehydrating the stigmas of the Crocus sativus
   flower, is a spice of great importance. In saffron, the flower emerges
   before leaf formation, thanks to the nutritional reserves of the corm.
   Early knowledge of metabolite levels such as crocins, picrocrocin,
   safranal, anthocyanins, or kaempferols in flowers serves as a guide to
   evaluate the quality of the corm (coloring power, flavor, aroma, or
   antioxidant capacity, among others). In this study, near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIR) was calibrated and validated to determine the main
   saffron metabolites, both in stigmas and in floral residue. To achieve
   this, saffron flowers from different locations of the Denomination of
   Origin (D.O.) ``Azafr \& aacute;n de La Mancha{''} (Castilla-La Mancha,
   Spain) were analyzed using NIR spectroscopy. Prior to this, samples were
   analyzed by RP-HPLC-DAD, where the concentration of all cited
   metabolites was determined. The development of a predictive model
   through NIR calibration and validation was successful, achieving high
   R-2 values, especially in the case of the sum of crocins and
   kaempferol-3-O-beta-sophoroside. Using these predictive models, it is
   possible to determine the quality of saffron corm by analyzing the
   flower.},

Title = {Application of hierarchical classification models and reliability
   estimation by bootstrapping, for authentication and discrimination of
   wine vinegars by UV-vis spectroscopy},
Journal = {CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {191},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, three Spanish wine vinegars have obtained the
   indication of Protected Denomination of Origin (PDOs) due to their
   unique characteristics and traditional method of production: ``Vinagre
   de Jerez{''}, ``Vinagre de Condado de Huelva{''} and ``Vinagre de
   Montilla-Moriles{''}. These vinegars are expensive due to their high
   quality, the long aging time and the high cost of production, reason why
   the adulteration and unfair competition in the vinegar industry are
   frequent practices. To avoid these frauds, several analytical techniques
   have been already studied for the characterization and authentication of
   these high quality vinegars. Nevertheless, ultra-violet-visible (UV-vis)
   spectroscopy, especially attractive for its simplicity and low cost, has
   not been previously used to assess PDO or other qualities as type of
   production or aging, in wine vinegars. For this reason, the potential of
   UV-vis spectroscopy was investigated for the first time as a rapid and
   inexpensive methodology for developing classification models to
   discriminate wine vinegars according to the production method, the PDO
   and the aging category. Spectra from 70 wine vinegars -including
   different categories within the 3 PDOs and also vinegars without PDO as
   known as rapid vinegars-have been analyzed and compared in the selected
   region of 280-600 nm. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used as
   exploratory method, while soft independent modelling-class (SIMCA) and
   partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed for
   the development of a hierarchical classification model. Differences
   between categories and PDOs, as well as between PDO and Non-PDO wine
   vinegars, were observed according to the spectral regions around 300 nm
   and the visible regions around 500 nm. Furthermore, bootstrap resampling
   method was employed to generate distributions of classification results
   and to obtain confidence intervals in the classification. The
   hierarchical classification results open up the possibility of
   developing a tool that provides an easy and fast differentiation for the
   authentication of wine vinegars from different categories and
   denomination of origins.},

Abstract = {Knowing the geographical origins of chili papers produced in specific
   areas is crucial because the geographical origins of various varieties
   of chili powder have a significant impact on their quality and price. In
   this research, for the first time, NIR (near-infrared) spectroscopy was
   used for the identification and classification of the geographical
   origin of chili powder of 6 different varieties, combining the method of
   PCA (principal component analysis) to extract relevant spectral features
   from the spectral data and segregate visible cluster trends, SIMCA (soft
   independent modeling of class analogy) statistically based
   classification model, and the four machine learning (ML) classifiers,
   including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest
   (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were applied for supervised
   classification. It was found that the SVM classifier, with a C value of
   4013.0 and gamma of 0.04125, delivered the highest cross-validation
   accuracy of 98.41\% and prediction accuracy of 97.22\%. The optimization
   process, guided by a detailed 3D contour plot, led to a model that not
   only generalized well but also offered remarkable precision, as
   confirmed by confusion matrices. The classification accuracy of the
   SIMCA model was 94.04\% for the calibration set and 84.74\% for the
   prediction set. The nonlinear SVM technique of classification
   outperformed the linear SIMCA model and other ML models. In general, the
   results indicated that chili powder from various geographic origins
   could be discriminated by the use of NIR spectroscopy combined with the
   SVM model quickly, nondestructively, and reliably.},

Abstract = {Art automated head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-based
   sampling procedure, coupled to gas chromatography-ion trap mass
   spectrometry (GC-ITMS), was developed and employed for fast
   characterisation of olive oil volatiles. In total, 914 samples were
   collected, over three production seasons, in north-western Italy-Liguria
   (n = 210) and other regions-in addition to the rest of Italy, Spain,
   France, Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey (n = 704) with the aim to
   distinguish, based on analytical (profiling) data, the olive oils
   labelled as ``Ligurian{''} (protected denomination of origin region,
   PDO) from all the others ({''}non-Ligurian{''}). For the chemometric
   analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural
   networks with multilayer perceptrons (ANN-MLP) were tested. Employing
   LDA, somewhat lower recognition (81.4\%) and prediction (61.7\%)
   abilities were obtained. The classification model was significantly
   improved using ANN-MLP. Under these conditions, the recognition (90.1\%)
   and prediction (81.1\%) abilities were achieved. The diagnostic value of
   the data obtained by one-dimensional GC-ITMS were compared with those
   generated by two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS), allowing a comprehensive analysis of olive
   oil volatiles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this work Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was selected
   as a reliable, fast and non-destructive technique to record
   spectroscopic fingerprints of Moroccan Protected Geographical Indication
   (PGI) Argan oils. Classification and discrimination according to their
   five geographical origins (Ait-Baha, Agadir, Essaouira, Tiznit and
   Taroudant) was performed. A total of 120 PGI Argan oil samples were
   collected during four harvest seasons between 2011 and 2014.First,
   several physicochemical parameters were measured, i.e. free acidity,
   peroxide value, spectrophotometric indices, fatty acid composition,
   tocopherols and sterols content. Secondly, FTIR fingerprints were
   recorded for all samples. The data was subjected to Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) for visualization and to reveal differences between
   samples. Classification models were developed by Partial Least Squares
   Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Mathematical data pre-treatments were
   applied to improve the performance of the multivariate classification
   models. The results obtained, based on both the chemical composition and
   the spectroscopic fingerprints, indicate that PCA plots were able to
   distinguish the five sample classes. PLS-DA models based on either
   chemical composition or FTIR spectra gave a good prediction and an
   accurate discrimination between the samples from different regions.
   The proposed approach with the FTIR spectra provided reliable results to
   classify the Moroccan PGI Argan oils from different regions in a rapid,
   inexpensive way requiring no prior separation procedure.},

Abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of discriminating monovarietal red wines
   from Touriga Nacional (TN), Touriga Franca (TF), and Tinta Roriz (TR)
   from Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) using the anthocyanin profile was
   investigated in combination with partial least squares ? discrimination
   analysis (PLS-DA), classification and regression trees (CART) and
   artificial neural networks (ANN). CART and ANN were more accurate in the
   classification of monovarietal wines according to their origin with a
   100\% classification rate in the test set. PLS-DA presented an accuracy
   of 91.4\%. The variables most important for monovarietal wines
   authentication were petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-acetylglucoside,
   and cyanidin-3-glucoside for the PLS-DA, petunidin-3glucoside,
   peonidin-3-acetylglucoside, and malvidin-3-acetylglucoside for CART
   analysis, and malvidin-3acetylglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside,
   malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-coumaroylglucoside and
   delphinidin3-glucoside for ANN. The results demonstrate that the
   anthocyanin profile of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, and Tinta Roriz
   Douro Denomination of Origin monovarietal red wines combined with
   multivariate analysis is an effective tool for verifying their

Abstract = {Viticulture zoning studies are important to delimit a legally protected
   territory and to control technologically a viticulture area. These
   zoning studies can be optimized by using new spectroscopic and
   geostatistical techniques. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
   assess the effectiveness of the near infrared reflectance (NIR)
   spectroscopy to estimate the main properties of soils, as well as the
   use of the estimated data to elaborate thematic maps. In this study was
   used the viticulture zone of the Protected Denomination of Origin
   Alicante for this interdisciplinary estimation. This work was carried
   out in three phases in order to improve the quality of soil available
   information by classical techniques of soil sampling and analysis,
   elaboration of a predictive model to estimate the properties of the
   soil, based on NIR spectroscopy. Finally, the direct and estimated
   information was incorporated in the thematic maps by Multilevel
   B-splines for spatial prediction of all territory of this region.
   Therefore, these steps were: (a) Soil classical zoning work of the
   Protected Denomination of Origin Alicante by the sampling of 117 points
   in areas of uniform characteristics and surface smaller than 2 hectares.
   In these samples were determined the electrical conductivity, the
   percentages of total calcium carbonate and organic matter and cationic
   exchange capacity. (b) Sampling of 20 new soils and estimation of the
   soil properties by a spectroscopic predictive model, using the near
   infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy. (c) Elaboration of thematic
   maps, using soil data determined by classical techniques or estimated by
   NIR spectroscopy.},

Title = {ICP-OES analysis coupled with chemometrics for the characterization and
   the discrimination of high added value Italian Emmer samples},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The elemental composition of 63 emmer samples produced in three
   different Italian territories, Monteleone di Spoleto (Umbria),
   Garfagnana (Tuscany) and National Park Gran Sasso-Laga (Abruzzo) were
   analyzed by Inductively Couples Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry
   (ICP-OES) combined with microwave-assisted digestion. The ICP-OES
   analytical method was validated to assess accuracy, precision and
   sensitivity. Recoveries were determined by the analysis of six genuine
   and six fortified emmer samples spiked at different concentrations.
   Recoveries (\%) varied from 83 to 100\% for the minor elements (Ba, Cu,
   Fe, Mn and Zn) detected in emmer in the 1-50 mu g/g concentration range
   (acceptable recovery range 80-110\%) and from 85 to 98\% for the major
   elements (Ca, K, Mg and P) whose concentration in emmer was within 0.2-5
   mg/g (acceptable recovery range 90-107\%). The observed LOD and LOQ
   values ranged from 0.02 to 1.03 mu g/g(dry) and from 0.07 to 3.44 mu
   g/g(dry), respectively, indicating a high sensitivity of the method.
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was preliminarily applied to investigate
   the significance of the detected elements (Ba, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ca, K, Mg
   and P) as geographical markers. Eventually, Partial Least
   Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify the samples
   according to their geographical origin. In order to validate the
   classification model, the 63 samples were divided into a training and a
   test set of 33 and 30 objects, respectively. The graphical investigation
   of the PLS-DA model highlighted that samples clearly group according to
   the geographical origin; this outcome is confirmed by the high accuracy
   achieved. In fact, the predictive model led to a correct classification
   rate of 100\% for all the external samples. The investigation of the
   biplot and the application of the Variable Importance in Prediction
   (VIP) analysis indicated that all the elements except Cu contributed to
   the characterization of the three different geographical classes.},

   Exploratory Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {The subject of generations and their differences has been intensely
   analyzed and debated. Each generation has its own characteristics,
   regardless of the element that differentiates them. Gen Z's relationship
   with tourism has been approached in recent years from various
   perspectives by many scholars. For the current research, representative
   characteristics were identified as important for Gen Z:
   off-the-beaten-path locations and experiences. Off-the-beaten-path
   locations refer to small-scale destinations, under-tourism, local
   businesses, sustainability, and local traditions. All of the aspects
   mentioned before are typical of rural tourism. Experiences are
   introduced by various elements of rural attractiveness: material
   cultural heritage (MCH) and immaterial (ICH), the living human treasures
   program (LHT), wine tourism, products with a protected designation of
   origin (PDO), products with a protected geographical indication (PGI),
   culinary diversity, and other rural leisure facilities. Two purposes
   have been established: to identify the relationship between Gen Z and
   rural tourism and its components defined by cultural heritage and
   traditional gastronomy, and to construct a predictive model regarding
   Gen Z's behavior when traveling to rural destinations. For this, we
   performed a quantitative investigation among university students from
   Romania using an online survey. Using 280 Gen Z respondents from 323
   valid responses, we performed a direct logistic regression. The results
   showed that they value local gastronomy and unique attractions, which we
   can include in MCH. The price represents an important element when
   choosing an accommodation unit. Due to the constantly increasing share
   of Gen Z in the tourism market, destinations and tourism operators will
   have time to prepare and adapt to new realities. Transversal research
   will benefit from the opportunity to compare Gen Z's preferences and
   changes over time.},

Abstract = {Background: Fruit spirits (FS) are distilled beverages produced in all
   parts of the world for local consumption, basically, of significant
   cultural value for regions or ethnic groups. The studies about FS are
   important because they preserve the traditions of local cultures and
   guarantee the quality of these products. Factors such as fruit variety,
   pH, fermentation and distillation practices, and storage conditions
   profoundly shape their chemical complexity. The growing appreciation for
   products with geographical identity and the absence of official data on
   artisanal production, however, has raised concerns regarding fraud,
   which may involve adulteration with industrial ethanol and the
   misrepresentation of origin, affecting both the regional culture,
   including economic effects, and public health. The uses of chemometric
   models, treatment of multivariate data, obtained by instrumental
   analytical techniques has emerged as the most promising approach to
   enhance traceability, protect geographical indications, and maintain
   consistent quality standards. Scope and approach: This review examines
   the current state of chemometric strategies in instrumental analysis
   data used to authenticate, classify, and identify FS. This paper
   examines the application of classical statistical methods (PCA, LDA,
   PLS-DA) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including SVM and
   ANN, to identify complex patterns and develop robust predictive models.
   The analytical techniques used to obtain the data were produced by
   high-resolution chromatographic techniques (GC-MS), Infrared with Mass
   Spectrometry (IRMS), Inductively Coupled Plasma com Mass Spectrometry
   (ICP/MS), and Raman Spectroscopy. Key findings and conclusions: The
   results demonstrate that the application of chemometric models in
   instrumental analytical data are important for deciphering the chemical
   complexity of the FS matrix. Techniques like GC-MS provide high
   resolution for volatiles, the integration of multi-signal data such as
   IRMS, ICP/MS, and vibrational spectroscopies offer greater predictive
   power for traceability. ML algorithms enhance quality control and
   authentication, providing accuracy and reliability in systems marked by
   high variability. The future direction points toward the consolidation
   of omics studies and the development of real-time predictive models that
   protect the terroir and authenticity of fruit spirits.},

Title = {A Fuzzy Rule Based Approach to Geographic Classification of Virgin Olive
   Oil Using T-Operators},
Booktitle = {POTENTIAL OF ESSENTIAL OILS},
Year = {2018},
Pages = {87-105},
Abstract = {Olive oil is an important agricultural food product. Especially,
   protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographic
   indications (PGI) are useful to protect the intellectual property rights
   of the consumers and producers. For this reason, the importance of the
   geographic classification increases to trace geographical indications.
   This chapter suggests a geographical classification system for the
   virgin olive oils. This system is formed on chemical parameters. These
   parameters include fuzziness. Novel proposed system constructs the rules
   by using fuzzy decision tree algorithm. It produces rules over fuzzy ID3
   algorithm. It uses fuzzy entropy on the fuzzified data. The reasoning
   procedure depends on weighted rule-based system and is adapted into the
   fuzzy reasoning handled with different T-operators. Fuzzification is
   performed with fuzzy c-means algorithm for the olive oil data set. The
   cluster numbers of each variable are selected based on partition
   coefficient validity criteria. The model is examined by using different
   decision tree approaches (C4.5 and standard version fuzzy ID3 algorithm)
   and FID3 reasoning method with eight different T-operators. Also, the
   conclusions are supported by statistical analysis. Experimental results
   support that the weights have important manner on fuzzy reasoning method
   for the geographic classification system.},

Abstract = {An electronic tongue based on amperometric detection in a flow injection
   system (FIA) and a commercial electronic nose have been used to
   characterize and classify four types of Barbera wines having different
   denominations of origin and produced in northern Italy in enclosed
   geographical areas.
   E-nose and e-tongue data were compared and elaborated together with
   those of chemical analysis and colour evaluation.
   All data were treated by multivariate data processing based on principal
   component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and
   classification and regression trees (CART) analysis.
   In the classification of Barbera wines the best results were obtained
   from LDA applied to electronic nose and electronic tongue data, this
   analysis giving 100\% correct assignation and 98.1\% correct prediction.

Abstract = {The geographical indication of pericarpium citri reticulatae (PCR) is
   very important in grading the quality and price of PCRs. Therefore,
   terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technology combined with
   convolutional neural networks (CNN) was proposed to distinguish PCRs of
   different origins without damage in this study. The one-dimensional CNN
   (1D-CNN) model with an accuracy of 82.99\% based on spectral data
   processed with SNV was established. The two-dimensional image features
   were transformed from unprocessed spectral data using the gramian
   angular field (GAF), the Markov transition field (MTF) and the
   recurrence plot (RP), which were used to build a two-dimensional CNN
   (2D-CNN) model with an accuracy of 78.33\%. Further, the CNN models with
   different fusion methods were developed for fusing spectra data and
   image data. In addition, the adding spectra and images based on the CNN
   (Add-CNN) model with an accuracy of 86.17\% performed better.
   Eventually, the Add-CNN model based on ten frequencies extracted using
   permutation importance (PI) achieved the identification of PCRs from
   different origins. Overall, the current study would provide a new method
   for identifying PCRs of different origins, which was expected to be used
   for the traceability of PCRs products.},

Abstract = {For Protected Geographical Indication (PGI)-labeled products, such as
   the dry-cured beef meat ``cecina de Leon{''}, a sensory analysis is
   compulsory. However, this is a complex and time-consuming process. This
   study explores the viability of using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
   together with artificial neural networks (ANN) for predicting sensory
   attributes. Spectra of 50 samples of cecina were recorded and 451
   reflectance data were obtained. A feedforward multilayer perceptron ANN
   with 451 neurons in the input layer, a number of neurons varying between
   1 and 30 in the hidden layer, and a single neuron in the output layer
   were optimized for each sensory parameter. The regression coefficient R
   squared (RSQ > 0.8 except for odor intensity) and mean squared error of
   prediction (MSEP) values obtained when comparing predicted and reference
   values showed that it is possible to predict accurately 23 out of 24
   sensory parameters. Although only 3 sensory parameters showed
   significant differences between PGI and non-PGI samples, the optimized
   ANN architecture applied to NIR spectra achieved the correct
   classification of the 100\% of the samples while the residual mean
   squares method (RMS-X) allowed 100\% of non-PGI samples to be
   distinguished.},

Abstract = {A well-known agricultural product in China, Wuyuan green tea is
   safeguarded by national geographical indications. In addition, the
   processed green tea must be free of contaminants like stones and tea
   stalks. Nevertheless, due to their similar colors, photoelectric sorting
   and 2D image recognition technologies are unable to distinguish tea
   stalks from Wuyuan green tea. In order to address the issue of incorrect
   sorting brought on by similar color matching, this paper uses
   hyperspectral imaging technology. Using a 400-1000 nm visible and
   near-infrared camera, green tea with tea stalks was photographed.
   Furthermore, the hyperspectral image that was gathered was reduced in
   dimension using principal component analysis. Additionally, tea stalks
   were successfully identified in hyperspectral images using the
   convolutional neural network, which can automatically learn the
   corresponding features and do away with the laborious feature extraction
   procedure. According to the experiment's findings, tea stalks can be

Abstract = {Panax notoginseng is a valuable herb with geographical indication, and
   the quality and price of P. notoginseng from different origins are very
   different. Therefore, this paper proposes a rapid and accurate method
   for identifying the origins of P. notoginseng by collecting the roots of
   P. notoginseng. This paper improves the whale optimization algorithm in
   terms of global convergence and convergence speed, introduces the Levy
   flight strategy and reconstructed whale synergy factor A, and applies it
   to the parameter optimization of support vector machines, to obtain a
   high-performance classification model. The improved whale optimization
   algorithm model identifies the origin of P. notoginseng by
   discriminating their terahertz spectra. Compared with the commonly used
   genetic algorithm and the original whale optimization algorithm,
   improvement in the whale optimization algorithm was able to avoid
   falling into local optimum solutions more effectively while having a
   high convergence rate. Accordingly, the improved whale optimization
   algorithm optimized support vector machine model obtained an overall
   accuracy of 98.44\%, which was significantly higher than the 95.31\%

Abstract = {The Italian hazelnut (Corylus avellana cultivar ``Tonda Gentile
   Trilobata{''} (TGT) is covered by protected geographical indication
   ``Nocciola Piemonte{''} and is well-known as the best-suited hazelnut
   for the industrial transformation into roasted kernel. The hazelnut
   cultivar identification is primarily based on morphological
   characteristics, so there is the need for more objective analytical
   methods for high quality hazelnut authentication. This study reports the
   H-1 NMR fingerprinting of raw and roasted hazelnut, with the aim of
   obtaining hazelnut classification based on their spectroscopic pattern.
   H-1 NMR analyses were carried out on polar extracts of TGT and other
   cultivars: the data were analysed with multivariate statistical methods.
   Results showed that H-1 NMR combined with chemometrics is useful to
   characterise the hazelnuts as a function of the cultivars, both on raw
   and roasted form. The classification models allowed identifying
   molecular markers useful to distinguish TGT from other types, among
   these trigonelline, amino acids and an unidentified orto-disubstituted
   aromatic compound. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {H-1 NMR spectroscopy was applied to analyse samples of ``Swabian-Hall
   Quality Pork{''} with protected geographical indication (PGI). To obtain
   maximum chemical information sample preparation was based on both polar
   extraction and non-polar extraction. A non-targeted approach was used to
   analyse the H-1 NMR data followed by principal component analysis (PCA),
   linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and cross-validation (CV) embedded
   in a Monte Carlo (MC) resampling approach. A total of 275 raw pork
   samples were collected in the years 2018 to 2021. The correct prediction
   rate of ``Swabian-Hall Quality Pork{''} was about 92\% on average for
   both models based on either the polar or non-polar metabolites. In
   addition, H-1 NMR data describing the polar and non-polar metabolites
   were combined in a classification model to improve the prediction
   accuracy. By performing a mid-level data fusion, a correct prediction
   rate of 98\% was achieved. Furthermore, spectral regions in the NMR
   spectra of the polar and non-polar metabolites that are relevant for the
   classification of the pork samples were identified to describe potential
   chemical marker compounds.},

Abstract = {The work was aimed at making a contribution to olive oil DOP (Protected
   Denomination of Origin) certification by evaluating how genetical
   factors can give a typical chemical fingerprint to olive oils. The olive
   oil samples investigated were obtained from homogeneous samples of
   monovarietal olives grown in various Italian regions; the olives were
   collected during the 1996 November/December olive harvest and crushed in
   a small-hammer metal mill. Fatty acid composition was determined by EU
   standard methods, whilst a modified saponification method, followed by
   purification on SPE, followed by GC analysis with a polar column of high
   thermal stability revealed the composition of the unsaponifiable
   fraction. Chemometrical methods resulted in the extrapolation of further
   useful information. A classification model for oils was created through
   Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) according to varietal origin.},

Title = {Robust and Automated Internal Quality Grading of a Chinese Green Tea
   (Longjing) by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Chemometrics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometric methods were applied to
   internal quality control of a Chinese green tea, Longjing, with
   Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). A total of 2745 authentic
   Longjing tea samples of three different grades were analyzed by NIR
   spectroscopy. To remove the influence of abnormal samples, The
   Stahel-Donoho estimate (SDE) of outlyingness was used for outlier
   analysis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was then
   used to classify the grades of tea based on NIR spectra. Different data
   preprocessing methods, including smoothing, taking second-order
   derivative (D2) spectra, and standard normal variate (SNV)
   transformation, were performed to reduce unwanted spectral variations in
   samples of the same grade before classification models were developed.
   The results demonstrate that smoothing, taking D2 spectra, and SNV can
   improve the performance of PLSDA models. With SNV spectra, the model
   sensitivity was 1.000, 0.955, and 0.924, and the model specificity was
   0.979, 0.952, and 0.996 for samples of three grades, respectively.
   FT-NIR spectrometry and chemometrics can provide a robust and effective
   tool for rapid internal quality control of Longjing green tea.},

Title = {Multi-Elemental Analysis for Geographical Tracing of Chickpeas Produced
   in Nearby Locations Around a Protected Geographical Indication},
Journal = {PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 30},
Abstract = {The multi-elemental profile has repeatedly been proposed as a reliable
   indicator of the geographical origin of plant-derived foods, as mineral
   composition accurately reflects the local soil geochemistry and
   environmental factors. However, this approach may fail in distinguishing
   specimens from nearby locations, which are expected to be exposed to
   similar geoclimatic conditions. Herein, we studied 70 chickpea samples
   collected in four southwestern Spanish provinces, two located within the
   Protected Geographical Indication `Garbanzo de Escacena' (i.e., Huelva
   and Sevilla), as well as other two boundary areas (i.e., C \& aacute;diz
   and C \& oacute;rdoba). Then, inductively-coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry was employed to simultaneously determine 31 trace elements
   and 16 rare-earth elements. Interestingly, we found great similarities
   in the mineral content of chickpeas cultivated in the regions ascribed
   to the Protected Geographical Indication, but these could be clearly
   discriminated from the rest of the samples. Afterward, the application
   of state-of-the-art machine learning tools provided predictive models
   with good performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity,
   and specificity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
   combination of multi-elemental analysis and advanced chemometrics could
   be a powerful strategy for food authentication and traceability
   according to the geographical origin.},

Title = {Rapid Analysis of Geographical Origins and Age of Torreya grandis
   Seeds by NIR Spectroscopy and Pattern Recognition Methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2013},
Abstract = {This paper develops a rapid method for discriminating the geographical
   origins and age of roasted Torreya grandis seeds by near infrared (NIR)
   spectroscopic analysis and pattern recognition. 337 samples were
   collected from three main producing areas and produced in the last two
   years. The objective of geographical origins analysis is to discriminate
   the seeds from Fengqiao with a protected geographical indication (PGI)
   from those of another two provinces. Age classification is aimed to
   detect the old seeds produced in the last year from the freshly produced
   ones. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was used to
   develop classification models, and the influence of data preprocessing
   methods on classification performance was also investigated. Taking
   second-order derivatives of the raw spectra proves to be the most proper
   and effective preprocessing method, which can remove baselines and
   backgrounds and reduce model complexity. With second derivative spectra,
   the sensitivity and specificity were 0.939 and 0.871 for age
   discrimination, respectively. Perfect classification was obtained, and
   both sensitivity and specificity were 1 for discrimination of
   geographical origins.},

   dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and total polyphenols) were used as
   descriptors to differentiate among classes. Supervised learning pattern
   recognition procedures were applied. Linear discriminant analysis
   allowed up to similar to 80\% of correct classification. To improve
   discriminatory accuracy, another kind of algorithm that can model
   nonlinear separation among classes was considered: artificial neural
   networks. This method obtained excellent results, with 100\% of the 140
   wines correctly placed into the associated seven classes. Our results
   are in good agreement with the working hypothesis of differentiation
   among wines coming from different locations, including both different
   islands and different sites on Tenerife Island.},

Title = {A Machine Learning Method for the Fine-Grained Classification of Green
   Tea with Geographical Indication Using a MOS-Based Electronic Nose},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Chinese green tea is known for its health-functional properties. There
   are many green tea categories, which have sub-categories with
   geographical indications (GTSGI). Several high-quality GTSGI planted in
   specific areas are labeled as famous GTSGI (FGTSGI) and are expensive.
   However, the subtle differences between the categories complicate the
   fine-grained classification of the GTSGI. This study proposes a novel
   framework consisting of a convolutional neural network backbone (CNN
   backbone) and a support vector machine classifier (SVM classifier),
   namely, CNN-SVM for the classification of Maofeng green tea categories
   (six sub-categories) and Maojian green tea categories (six
   sub-categories) using electronic nose data. A multi-channel input matrix
   was constructed for the CNN backbone to extract deep features from
   different sensor signals. An SVM classifier was employed to improve the
   classification performance due to its high discrimination ability for
   small sample sizes. The effectiveness of this framework was verified by
   comparing it with four other machine learning models (SVM, CNN-Shi,
   CNN-SVM-Shi, and CNN). The proposed framework had the best performance
   for classifying the GTSGI and identifying the FGTSGI. The high accuracy
   and strong robustness of the CNN-SVM show its potential for the
   fine-grained classification of multiple highly similar teas.},

Abstract = {Wuchang rice is a geographical indication product in China. Due to its
   high quality and low production, the phenomenon of fake is more and more
   serious. An effective identification method of Wuchang rice is urgent
   needed, for the maintenance of its brand image and interest of
   consumers. Base on the content of inorganic elements which are analyzed
   by ICP-AES and ICP-MS in rice, the identification model of Wuchang rice
   is studied combining with principal component analysis (PCA), Fisher
   discrimination and artificial neural network (ANN) in this paper. The
   effect on the identification of samples is poor through PCA, while the
   samples from Wuchang area and other areas can be identified accurately
   through Fisher discrimination and ANN. The average accurate
   identification ratio of training and verification set through Fisher
   discrimination is 93.5\%, while the average accurate identification
   ratio through ANN is 96.4\%. The ability to identify of ANN is better
   than Fisher discrimination. Wuchang rice can be identified accurately

Abstract = {Identification of fake green tea is performed by sensory assessment
   which has significant drawbacks in terms of objectivity. In this works,
   sensory assessment and electronic tongue were utilized for identifying
   fake green tea. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical
   Cluster Analysis (HCA) were used to assess the feasibility and
   effectiveness of discrimination of electronic tongue. The PCA and HCA
   revealed a distinct separation between samples, which corresponded with
   the results of sensory assessment. Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
   including back propagation neural network with the Levenberg-Marquardt
   training algorithm (LMBP) and radial basis function neural network
   (RBF), were used as an automatic classifier and showed good performance
   in the training set and the prediction set. The results suggest that
   electronic tongue can be used for distinguishing fake Dongting Biluochun
   Tea from certified products characterized by protection of geographical
   indications product certification with pattern recognition methods

Abstract = {Classical multivariate analysis techniques such as factor analysis and

   method (ANN) have been applied to the classification of Spanish
   denomination of origin (DO) rose wines according to their geographical

   vintages were studied. Nineteen different variables were measured in
   these wines. The stepwise linear discriminant analyses (SLDA) model
   selected 10 variables obtaining a global percentage of correct
   classification of 98.8\% and of global prediction of 97.3\%. The ANN
   model selected seven variables, five of which were also selected by the
   SLDA model, and it gave a 100\% of correct classification for training
   and prediction. So, both models can be considered satisfactory and
   acceptable, being the selected variables useful to classify and
   differentiate these wines by their origin. Furthermore, the casual index
   analysis gave information that can be easily explained from an
   enological point of view. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Jinhua ham, a geographical indication agriculture product in China,
   possesses exquisite flavor during fermentation. Three-year Jinhua ham is
   highly valued for superior flavor and nutrition, but current
   age-discrimination relies on the experience of workers, leaving high
   adulteration risks. In this study, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry
   (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) were
   adopted to analyze the differences of flavor compounds in Jinhua ham
   aged for 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 years. Fifty-four aroma-active compounds were
   identified through OAV >= 1 from Jinhua ham with different ages, with
   the flavor changing from mushroom to citrus/grassy/buttery, then nutty,
   and finally to dominant coconut, peach, and floral-fatty notes. And 18
   key discriminative compounds were screened out through plotted compounds
   content distribution. Further, 1-octen-3-ol and decanoic acid were found
   applicable for discriminating the age of ham based on the scatter plot
   and SHAP value. Then, four age-discriminating machine-learning models
   (LR, SVM, NB, and DT) were constructed and exhibited high accuracy, with
   the highest reaching 100 \%. Especially, a portable ham quality
   evaluation circuit was constructed based on the DT classification models
   due to its good generalization ability and concise structure. This study
   provides a theoretical basis for accurately predicting ages of Jinhua
   ham by GC-MS with machine learning.},

Abstract = {The approach presented herein reports the application of a voltammetric
   electronic tongue (ET), in contrast with a wine tasting sensory panel,
   as a tool for standardized wine tasting; concretely, to achieve the
   discrimination of different wine DOs (Denominacion de Origen, a mark
   related to its geographical region and ensuring high-quality levels) and
   the prediction of the global score assigned by the trained sensory
   panel. To this aim, a voltammetric array of sensors based on metallic
   and bulk-modified graphite electrodes was used as the sensing part,
   while chemometric tools such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and
   artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used as the qualitative and
   quantitative modelling tools. Departure information was the set of
   voltammograms, which were first preprocessed employing fast Fourier
   transform(FFT), followed by removal of less-significant coefficients
   employing a stepwise inclusion method and pruning of the inputs. The
   trend, in global scores, was modelled successfully with a 92.9\% of
   correct identification for the qualitative application, and a
   correlation coefficient of 0.830 for the quantitative one (with 14 and
   20 samples for the external test subsets, respectively). (C) 2014

   green coffee beans},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Coffee is widely consumed across the globe. The most sought out
   varieties are Arabica and Robusta which differ significantly in their
   aroma and taste. Furthermore, varieties cultivated in different regions
   are perceived to have distinct characteristics encouraging some
   producers to adopt the denomination of origin label. These differences
   arise from variations on metabolite content related to edaphoclimatic
   conditions and post-harvest management among other factors. Although
   sensory analysis is still standard for coffee brews, instrumental
   analysis of the roasted and green beans to assess the quality of the
   final product has been encouraged. Metabolomic profiling has risen as a
   promising approach not only for quality purposes but also for geographic
   origin assignment. Many techniques can be applied for sample analysis:
   chromatography, mass spectrometry, and NMR have been explored. The data
   collected is further sorted by multivariate analysis to identify similar
   characteristics among the samples, reduce dimensionality and/or even
   propose a model for predictive purposes. This review focuses on the
   evolution of metabolomic profiling for the geographic origin assessment
   of roasted and green coffee beans in the last 21 years, the techniques
   that are usually applied for sample analysis and also the most common
   approaches for the multivariate analysis of the collected data. The
   prospect of applying a wide range of analytical techniques is becoming
   an unbiased approach to determine the origin of different roasted and
   green coffee beans samples with great correlation. Predictive models
   worked accurately for the geographic assignment of unknown samples once
   the variety was known.},

Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The identification of the geographical origin of tea is a long-standing
   challenge. However, green and recyclable identification methods
   applicable to tea geographic origin are still missing. Therefore, this
   study aims to explore the feasibility of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR)
   and machine learning for geographic origin traceability and component
   detection in flat green tea. One hundred flat tea samples with 50
   geographical indication (GI) and 50 non-GI labels of Longjing tea were
   evaluated. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in both tea
   polyphenols and free amino acids between GI and non-GI samples. The
   nonlinear SVM model based on MIR achieved accurate identification for 34
   tea samples with an accuracy of 97.06 \%. The nonlinear SVR and linear
   CARS-PLSR models achieved the quantification of tea polyphenols and
   amino acids with RMSE values of 0.78 \% and 0.09 \%, respectively. The
   SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values further indicated that the
   wavenumbers at 2196 (negatively contributing), 1988 (positively
   contributing) and 2181 cm(-1) (positively contributing) were dominated
   in predicting the geographical origin, tea polyphenols and amino acids,
   respectively, thereby contributing to the accuracy of the models. This
   study offers a reliable model for the traceability of geographic origin
   in agricultural products.},

Title = {Screening of grated cheese authenticity by nir spectroscopy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {44},

Pages = {264-267},
Abstract = {Parmigiano-Reggiano (PR) cheese is one of the oldest traditional cheeses
   produced in Europe, and it is still one of the most valuable Protected
   Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses of Italy. The denomination of origin
   is extended to the grated cheese when manufactured exclusively from
   whole Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese wheels that respond to the production
   standard. The grated cheese must be matured for a period of at least 12
   months and characterized by a rind content not over 18\%. In this
   investigation the potential of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), coupled
   to different statistical methods, were used to estimate the authenticity
   of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese PDO. Cheese samples were classified
   as: compliance PR, competitors, non-compliance PR (defected PR), and PR
   with rind content greater then 18\%. NIR spectra were obtained using a
   spectrophotometer Vector 22/N (Bruker Optics, Milan, Italy) in the
   diffuse reflectance mode. Instrument was equipped with a rotating
   integrating sphere. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted for
   an explorative spectra analysis, while the Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANN) were used to classify spectra, according to different cheese
   categories. Subsequently the rind percentage and month of ripening were
   estimated by a Partial Least Squares regression (PLS). Score plots of
   the PCA show a clear separation between compliance PR samples and the
   rest of the sample was observed. Competitors samples and the defected PR
   samples were grouped together. The classification performance for all
   sample classes, obtained by ANN analysis, was higher of 90\%, in test
   set validation. Rind content and month of ripening were predicted by PLS
   a with a determination coefficient greater then 0.95 (test set).
   These results showed that the method can be suitable for a fast
   screening of grated cheese authenticity.},

Title = {Geographical Indication Characteristics of Aroma and Phenolic Acids of
   the Changping Strawberry},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Strawberry is the most consumed berry fruit worldwide due to its unique
   aroma and high nutritive value. This fruit is also an important source
   of phenolic compounds. Changping strawberries are recognized as a
   national agricultural product of geographical indication (GI) due to
   their unique flavor. Widely accepted standards for identifying GI
   strawberries from non-GI strawberries are currently unavailable. This
   study compared the aroma and phenolic acid composition of GI and non-GI
   strawberries. Furthermore, the characteristic aroma and phenolic acid
   markers of GI strawberries were determined. A classification model based
   on the markers was established using Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA).
   In this study, six groups of strawberries with variety name of
   ``Hongyan{''}, including GI strawberries from Changping and non-GI
   strawberries from Changping, Miyun, Pinggu, Shunyi, and Tongzhou, were
   collected. A total of 147 volatile substances were discovered using gas
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The contents of a few compounds
   principally responsible for the distinctive aroma in GI strawberries
   were in the top three of the six groups, providing GI strawberries with
   a generally pleasant fragrance. OPLS-DA identified isoamyl butyrate and
   trans-2-octen-1-ol as characteristic markers. Enrichment analysis
   indicated that beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids,
   mitochondrial beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, fatty acid
   biosynthesis, and butyrate metabolism played critical roles in volatile
   compound biosynthesis. The total phenolic content was 24.41-36.46 mg/kg
   of fresh weight. OPLS-DA results revealed that cinnamic acid could be
   used as a characteristic phenolic acid marker of GI strawberries. Based
   on the three characteristic markers, FDA was performed on the different
   groups, which were then divided. The separation of strawberry samples
   from different origins using the three characteristic markers was found
   to be feasible. These findings help effectively understand the aroma and
   phenolic acid composition of strawberries and contribute to the
   development of strawberries with a pleasant fragrance and health
   benefits.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a method for the protected geographical indication
   discrimination of Ophiopogon japonicus from Zhejiang and elsewhere using
   near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. A total of
   3657 Ophiopogon japonicus samples from five major production areas in
   China were analyzed by NIR spectroscopy, and divided into 2127 from
   Zhejiang and 1530 from other areas ('non-Zhejiang'). Principal component
   analysis (PCA) was selected to screen outliers and eliminate them. Monte
   Carlo cross validation (MCCV) was introduced to divide the training set
   and test set according to a ratio of 3:7. The raw spectra were
   preprocessed by nine single and partial combination methods such as the
   standard normal variable (SNV) and derivative, and then modeled by
   partial least squares regression (PLSR), a support vector machine (SVM),
   and soft independent modeling of class analogies (SIMCA). The effects of
   different pretreatment and chemometrics methods on the model are
   discussed. The results showed that the three pattern recognition methods
   were effective in geographical origin tracing, and selecting the
   appropriate preprocessing method could improve the traceability
   accuracy. The accuracy of PLSR after the standard normal variable was
   better, with R-2 reaching 0.9979, while that of the second derivative
   was the lowest with an R-2 of 0.9656. After the SNV pretreatment, the
   accuracy of the training set and test set of SVM reached the highest
   values, which were 99.73\% and 98.40\%, respectively. The accuracy of
   SIMCA pretreated with SNV and MSC was the highest for the origin
   traceability of Ophiopogon japonicus, which could reach 100\%. The
   distance between the two classification models of SIMCA-SNV and
   SIMCA-MSC is greater than 3, indicating that the SIMCA model has good
   performance.},

Title = {Discrimination of geographical indication of Chinese green teas using an
   electronic nose combined with quantum neural networks: A portable
   strategy},

Abstract = {Sensory attributes of teas are related to their geographical origin and
   directly affect consumer preference and thus the value of products. In
   this paper, we propose a portable strategy of identifying five famous
   green teas with official geographical indications of China using a
   lab-made electronic nose combined with a quantum neural network (QNN).
   QNN can be regarded as a modified version of back propagation neural
   network (BPNN), in which transfer functions are superposed by several
   sigmoids forming multilevel intervals and can be adjusted during
   training. Firstly, principal component analysis and linear discriminant
   analysis are used for lowdimensional visualization. Then different QNNs
   with 2-6 quantum intervals are trained and tested compared with BPNN,
   support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The results
   show that averaged classification accuracies of QNNs are higher than
   that of BPNN, SVM and k-NN, and they raise with increasing of initial
   quantum intervals but vary a little when quantum intervals exceed 3, and
   reach highest to 99.38 \%, indicating 3 quantum intervals is adequate
   for this application considering the trade-off between calculating cost
   and classification accuracy. The results demonstrate that QNN is a
   promising pattern recognition method for portable electronic noses due
   to its better generalization ability but simple implementation as a
   conventional BPNN.},

Title = {Multi-Elemental Analysis and Geographical Discrimination of Greek
   ``Gigantes Elefantes{''} Beans Utilizing Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
   Spectrometry and Machine Learning Models},
Journal = {FOODS},

Abstract = {Greek giant beans, also known as ``Gigantes Elefantes{''} (elephant
   beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L.,) are a traditional and highly cherished
   culinary delight in Greek cuisine, contributing significantly to the
   economic prosperity of local producers. However, the issue of food fraud
   associated with these products poses substantial risks to both consumer
   safety and economic stability. In the present study, multi-elemental
   analysis combined with decision tree learning algorithms were
   investigated for their potential to determine the multi-elemental
   profile and discriminate the origin of beans collected from the two
   geographical areas. Ensuring the authenticity of agricultural products
   is increasingly crucial in the global food industry, particularly in the
   fight against food fraud, which poses significant risks to consumer
   safety and economic stability. To ascertain this, an extensive
   multi-elemental analysis (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu,
   Fe, Ga, Ge, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, Se, Sr, Ta,
   Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Zn, and Zr) was performed using Inductively Coupled
   Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Bean samples originating from
   Kastoria and Prespes (products with Protected Geographical Indication
   (PGI) status) were studied, focusing on the determination of elemental
   profiles or fingerprints, which are directly related to the geographical
   origin of the growing area. In this study, we employed a decision tree
   algorithm to classify Greek ``Gigantes Elefantes{''} beans based on
   their multi-elemental composition, achieving high performance metrics,
   including an accuracy of 92.86\%, sensitivity of 87.50\%, and
   specificity of 96.88\%. These results demonstrate the model's
   effectiveness in accurately distinguishing beans from different
   geographical regions based on their elemental profiles. The trained
   model accomplished the discrimination of Greek ``Gigantes Elefantes{''}
   beans from Kastoria and Prespes, with remarkable accuracy, based on
   their multi-elemental composition.},

Abstract = {A simple and economic high-performance liquid chromatography with UV-vis
   detection (HPLC-UV) metabolomic fingerprinting methodology was developed
   and applied after a water extraction procedure to obtain sample chemical
   descriptors suitable for meat authentication by chemometrics. Three
   hundred meat samples involving different species (lamb, beef, pork,
   rabbit, quail, chicken, turkey, and duck) as well as different
   non-genetic attributes (protected geographical indications, organic
   production, and Halal and Kosher meats) were analyzed, and the obtained
   HPLC-UV fingerprints subjected to PCA and PLS-DA for classification and
   authentication. Excellent PLS-DA discrimination and classification
   performance was accomplished for calibration and cross-validation, with
   sensitivity and specificity values higher than 100\% and 99.3\%,
   respectively, and classification errors below 0.4\%, when meat species
   were considered. The prediction capability when employing a
   classification decision tree consisting on consecutive dual PLS-DA
   models built using a hierarchical model builder was of 100\% accuracy
   when 48 meat samples were subjected to the model as unknown samples.
   Multiclass PLS-DA classification performances when addressing meat
   geographical origin, organic productions and Halal and Kosher products
   were also very acceptable, with overall sensitivity and specificity
   values higher than 91.2\%, and classification errors below 6.9\%.
   Finally, fraudulent meat adulteration cases involving PGI, organic and
   Halal and Kosher adulterated meats were evaluated by partial least
   squares (PLS) regression, allowing the detection and quantitation of
   adulteration levels within the range from 15 to 85\% with prediction
   errors below 6.6\%, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed
   methodology to assess meat authenticity.},

Title = {Development of the POLIVAR model using neural networks as a tool to
   predict and identify monovarietal olive oils},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The growing consumer demand for varietal olive oils of differentiated
   properties necessitates implementing systematic procedures and tools
   that serve to detect fraud or alterations. The olive variety is,
   furthermore, a factor that guarantees and certifies an oil belongs to
   one of the registered geographical indications established in the
   European Union. The aim of this work was, by means of deploying
   artificial neural networks (ANNs), to develop a model that enables
   monovarietal olive oils to be predicted and identified, using a minimal
   number of chemical parameters, ensuring highly accurate quality control.
   To develop the model, we use data from 124 plots in areas assigned to
   protected designations of origin and quality marks in the region of
   Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). The results are influenced by the different
   content of the chemical parameters and show that with the analysis of
   only one parameter (margaroleic acid), the overall accuracy achieved
   (OAA) is 62.35\%, rising to 91.50\% when three parameters are included
   (stearic and oleic acids and concentration of campesterol) and 98.79\%
   with five parameters (palmitic, stearic, linoleic and arachidic acids
   and concentration of campesterol). The development of the POLIVAR
   (Prediction of OLIve oil VARieties) model enables some of the most
   important monovarietal olive oils to be identified, thus being a useful
   tool to safeguard product quality and consumer interest.},

   extracted from Coalho cheeses obtained from four different mesoregions
   of Bahia, Brazil, from seven different producing factories. 70 samples
   were collected within 10 days of manufacture and analyzed using RP-HPLC
   and MIR. The RP-HPLC indicated five markers peptides for cheese
   differentiation and the MIR revealed spectroscopic profiles of amides
   with distinct absorptions, varying according to geographic origin. Using
   the Principal Component Analysis, the MIR correctly discriminated the
   peptide profiles of the cheeses by origin, presenting distinct groups in
   three-dimensional space and the Artificial Neural Networks models were
   efficient in correctly classifying all cheeses in their respective
   groups of validation, associated with low error rates (RMSEVRP-HPLC =
   0.0165, RMSEVMIR = 0.0488). The results showed that RP-HPLC and MIR
   discriminated the origin of Coalho cheese and the MIR presented itself
   as an alternative of lower operational cost, fast, efficient and robust

   agricultural products: A hybrid PLS-SEM and ANN approach},

Year = {2025},

Abstract = {In recent years, the sales of Geographical Indication agricultural
   products (GI agri-products) have increased annually, yet various aspects
   of their perceived value remain inadequately defined. This study
   reconstructs the perceived value model for GI agri-products based on
   their unique regional attributes, while also integrating the Theory of
   Planned Behavior (TPB). Aims to delve into these factors to clarify how
   GI products attract consumers and influence their purchase decisions. A
   mixed-method approach was employed, combining PLS-SEM and Artificial
   Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze data collected from 358 consumers in
   the Chinese market. Notably, ANN complements SEM by addressing its
   limitations in capturing nonlinear relationships. Results indicate that
   perceived value is the primary driver of purchase intentions, followed
   by attitude and perceived behavioral control, with subjective norms
   having a lesser yet still significant impact. These insights provide
   valuable implications for marketing strategies, assisting stakeholders
   in effectively promoting GI agri-products. By enhancing consumers'
   experiences of the non-functional value of GI agri-products, marketing
   efforts for these products can be more effectively realized.},

Abstract = {Tropea red onion (Allium cepa L. var. Tropea) is among the most highly
   appreciated Italian products. It is cultivated in specific areas of
   Calabria and, due to its characteristics, was recently awarded with the
   protected geographical indications (PGI) certification from the European
   Union. A reliable classification of onion samples in groups
   corresponding to ``Tropea{''} and ``non-Tropea{''} categories is now
   available to the producers. This important goal has been achieved
   through the evaluation of three supervised chemometric approaches. Onion
   samples with PGI brand (120) and onion samples not cultivated following
   the production regulations (80) were digested by a closed-vessel
   microwave oven system. ICP-MS equipped with a dynamic reaction cell was
   used to determine the concentrations of 25 elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce,
   Cr, Dy, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ho, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Ni, Pr, Rb, Sm, Sr, Tl,
   Y, and Zn). The multielement fingerprint was processed using linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) (standard and stepwise), soft independent
   modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and back-propagation artificial
   neural network (BP-ANN). The cross-validation procedure has shown good
   results in terms of the prediction ability for all of the chemometric
   models: standard LDA, 94.0\%; stepwise LDA, 94.5\%; SIMCA, 95.5\%; and
   BP-ANN, 91.5\%.},

Abstract = {Fraud is rampant in the tea market globally, and a real-time online tea
   identification method is needed to improve transparency in the tea
   production industry. In order to detect the origin of Pu `er ripe tea,
   twodimensional gray image data of tea were extracted based on
   Hyperspectral imaging technology, and AlexNet model was established. The
   results show that the modeling effect is best when the data are
   subjected to multivariate scattering correction+Savitzky Golay (MSC+SG)
   preprocessing and the size of the first layer of convolutional kernel is
   set to 9 x 9, and the accuracy of recognizing the origin of Pu'er ripe
   tea reaches 95.66 \%. The classification accuracy is 6.25 \% and 8.22 \%
   higher than that of support vector machine (SVM) and partial least
   squares-discriminant analysis (PLSR-DA), which are traditional machine
   learning models based on spectral data, respectively. To validate the
   effectiveness and generalization of the model, the extracted features
   were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
   (tSNE); and external validation and visualization based on the AlexNet
   model was performed on 1200 samples with an accuracy of over 96.50 \%.
   Overall, HSI combined with AlexNet model can be a fast and accurate
   detection method to recognize the origin of Pu'er ripe tea.},

Abstract = {Most existing studies have focused on identifying the origin of species
   with protected geographical indications while neglecting to determine
   the proximate geographical origin of different species. In this study,
   we investigated the feasibility of using near- and mid-infrared
   spectroscopy to identify the origin of 156 Polygonatum kingianum samples
   from six regions in Yunnan, China. In this work, spectral images of
   different modes reveal more information about the P. kingianum.
   Comparing the performance of traditional machine learning models
   according to single spectrum and data fusion, the middle-level data
   fusion-principal component model has the best performance, and its
   sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are all 1, and the model has the
   least number of variables. The residual convolutional neural network
   (ResNet) model constructed in the 1050-850 cm(-1) band confirms that
   fewer variables are beneficial in improving the accuracy of the model.
   In conclusion, this study verifies the feasibility of the proposed
   strategy and establishes a practical model to determine the source of P.
   kingianum.},

Abstract = {A rapid, objective, and effective method for determining the origin of
   agricultural products is crucial for ensuring food safety and protecting
   the rights of geographical indication products. In this study, we
   propose an adaptive gas feature calculation and classification method,
   integrated with an electronic nose (e-nose), to identify the origin of
   agricultural products. Specifically, we propose a global synthetic
   attention (GSA) that adaptively focus on important gas features across
   both the time-series and sensor dimensions. Furthermore, peak factor,
   integral value, and steady-state mean are calculated to enhance temporal
   feature representation. Gas information from rice and soybean sourced
   from different origins is collected using PEN3 e-nose. The average
   classification results of five-fold cross-validation show that the
   adaptive gas feature calculation and classification method (LeNet+GSA)
   achieves 98.71\% accuracy, 98.89\% precision, and 98.67\% recall for
   rice origin identification, while attaining 98.94\% accuracy, 99.13\%
   precision, and 98.87\% recall for soybean origin identification.},

Abstract = {In this investigation the potential of infrared spectroscopy, coupled to
   different statistical methods, were used to estimate the authenticity of
   grated Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) Parmigiano Reggiano cheese
   (P-R). The feasibility of the analytical approach in the prediction of
   cheese authenticity without the use of wet chemistry was evaluated. A
   total of 400 plastic-sealed grated cheese samples classified as:
   compliance P-R, competitors, non-compliance P-R (defected P-R), and P-R
   with rind content of >18\%. PCA was conducted for an explorative spectra
   analysis. Soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) analysis
   and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to classify samples,
   according to different cheese categories. For both the spectroscopic
   techniques, PCA correctly discriminated compliance P-R from competitors,
   but not the P-R as a function of the rind percentage and months of
   ripening. SIMCA analysis accurately classified the compliance and
   competitors' P-R samples, while samples belonging to the classes of
   defected P-R and P-R with rind content >18\% were not accurately
   classified. ANN was more efficient than SIMCA in the classification of
   all the cheese classes. The results showed that NIR and MIR combined
   with different statistical approaches can be suitable for a sensitive,
   non-destructive, rapid and inexpensive screening of grated P-R cheese
   authenticity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   of geographical indications for Gastrodia elata Blume},
Journal = {FOOD BIOSCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {56},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Gastrodia elata Blume (G. elata Bl.), with its excellent nutritional and
   medicinal value from Zhaotong, has been protected by geographical
   indication (GI). Accurate certification of its origin is a prerequisite
   to safeguard consumer interests and maintain the market. Four different
   regions and three varieties of G. elata Bl. from Zhaotong were used in
   this study (n = 262). Tri-step infrared spectroscopy was used for
   ATR-FTIR spectral analysis to filter out fingerprint regions for data
   fusion with FT-NIR spectra, after which conventional discrim-inant
   models (PLS-DA and GS-SVM) were built. The second derivative (SD),
   multiple scattering correction (MSC), and Savitzky-Golay (SG)
   preprocessing were also performed on the spectra, and it was found that
   the pre-processing improved the performance of the PLS-DA model. The
   optimal model results in GS-SVM, based on mid-level data fusion of
   principal components (PCs) and latent variables (LVs), with sensitivity,
   specificity, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1
   for the test set. Furthermore, the residual convolutional neural network
   (ResNet) models were built, based on FT-NIR full spectra, band 3600-2700
   cm-1 (MFA) and band 1750-500 cm-1 (MFB). Their accuracy in both train
   and test sets exceeds 97\%, and the loss function curve is close to 0,
   which indicates that these three bands can be used as a fingerprint area
   to verify the GI of Zhaotong G. elata Bl. This study provides a fast,
   non-invasive method for the authentication of food or medicinal plant
   GI.},

Title = {A Transfer Learning Method for the Protection of Geographical Indication

Abstract = {Xihu Longjing (XHLJ) tea is one of the most precious teas in China;
   however, illegal dealers mislabel lower-quality teas as XHLJ tea and
   introduce them to the market. A rapid, easy, and accurate approach for
   the detection of the producing area and harvest time is necessary to
   protect the geographical indication of XHLJ tea as a Chinese product and
   to maintain market order. In this study, a MOS-based electronic nose
   (E-nose) was applied to distinguish different qualities of XHLJ tea. A
   transfer learning method called TrLightGBM (a combination of a transfer
   component analysis (TCA) strategy and a LightGBM classifier) is proposed
   to solve the problem of the differences in the distributions of data
   measured by the E-nose over long intervals, and can improve the
   classification accuracy of the XHLJ tea. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed TrLightGBM model achieved the best
   performance for the identification of different producing areas and
   harvest times as compared to five other machine learning models (the
   support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and
   backpropagation neural network). The proposed TrLightGBM model can avoid
   the data re-collection and waste of the E-nose, and is a potential tool
   to maintain order in the Chinese tea market and promote the practical
   application of E-nose devices.},

Abstract = {One-class classifiers are widely used to solve the classification
   problems where control or class modeling of a target class is necessary,
   e.g., untargeted analysis of food adulterations and frauds, tracing the
   origins of a food with Protected Denomination of Origin, fault
   diagnosis, etc. Recently, one-class partial least squares (OCPLS) has
   been developed and demonstrated to be a useful technique for class
   modeling. For analysis of nonlinear and outlier-contaminated data,
   nonlinear and robust OCPLS algorithms are required.
   This paper describes a free MATLAB toolbox for class modeling using
   OCPLS classifiers. The toolbox includes ordinary, nonlinear and robust
   OCPLS methods. The nonlinear algorithm is based on the Gaussian radial
   basis function (GRBF), and the robust algorithm is based on the partial
   robust M-regression (PRM). The usage of the toolbox is demonstrated by
   analysis of a real data set. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Panax notoginseng (P. notoginseng) is a traditional medicinal plant with
   high medicinal and economic values. The authenticity of P. notoginseng
   often determines its quality, and the quality of geographical indication
   (GI)-producing areas is usually superior to that of other producing
   areas, which are exploited by unscrupulous traders and affect the market
   order. The aim of this study was to characterize and identify the
   geographic origin of P. notoginseng using Fourier transform
   near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy, with rapid detection combined with
   multivariate analysis. The use of principal component analysis and
   correlation spectral analysis enabled the initial differential
   characterization and identification of P. notoginseng from different
   production areas. Then, random forest (RF) and support vector machine
   (SVM) models were established, and the results show that the results
   showed that the second-order derivative preprocessing and successive
   projection algorithm feature extraction achieved 100\% classification
   correctness and the model training time is the shortest. Further
   constructing the image recognition model, synchronous two-dimensional
   correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) image combined with residual
   convolutional neural network achieved accurate classification (accuracy
   of 100\%) and did not require complex preprocessing and artificial
   feature extraction process, to maximize the avoidance of errors caused
   by human factors. The recognition results of the externally validated
   set showed that the image recognition method has a strong generalization
   ability and has a high potential for application in the identification
   of P. notoginseng production areas.},

   geographical indication discrimination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},

Abstract = {Authentication of geographical indication (GI) is important for the
   protection of GI rice due to its unique quality characteristics and high
   economic value in the market. This paper compared the appearance
   quality, cooking quality and nutritional quality of four types of GI
   rice products (Luoding rice, Zhefang Tribute rice, Xijiang rice and
   Wanbaozhen rice) in China. Luoding rice was found to have the highest
   nutritional value with respect to protein and amino acid profile. The
   vitamin content of Xijiang rice was significantly higher than that of
   other types of GI rice. Principal component analysis showed that Luoding
   rice had a quite different protein, aspect ratio and amino acid profile
   from other GI rice samples. Zhefang Tribute rice had quite different
   cooking quality, fatty acid and sugar profile from Xijiang rice and
   Wanbaozhen rice. Geographical origin was predicted by using a multilayer
   perceptron artificial neural network model with quality characteristics
   as the input variables. It was found that all the samples were
   accurately predicted in both training and test sets, indicating the
   potential of using quality characteristics to discriminate GI rice
   samples from different geographical origins.},

Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY-X},

Abstract = {This study successfully combined widely targeted lipidomic with a back
   propagation (BP) neural network optimized based on a particle swarm
   algorithm to identify the authenticity of Yanchi Tan lamb. An electronic
   nose and gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS)
   were used to explore the flavor differences in Tan lamb from various
   regions. Among the 17 identified volatile compounds, 16 showed
   significant regional differences (p < 0.05). Lipidomic identified 1080
   molecules across 41 lipid classes, with 11 lipids, including Carnitine
   15:0, Carnitine 17:1, and Carnitine C8:1-OH, serving as potential
   markers for Yanchi Tan lamb. In addition, a stepwise linear discriminant
   model and three types of BP neural networks were used to identify the
   origin of Tan lamb. The results showed that particle swarm
   optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) neural network had the best
   prediction effect, with 100 \% prediction accuracy in both the training
   and test sets. The established PSO-BP model was able to achieve
   effective discrimination between Yanchi and non-Yanchi Tan lamb. These
   results provide a comprehensive perspective on the discrimination of
   Yanchi Tan lambs and improve the understanding of Tan lamb flavor and
   lipid composition in relation to origin.},

   achieved the effective wavelengths selection, the highest prediction

Abstract = {This study demonstrates that it is possible to characterise the vinegars
   obtained from wines with Certified Denomination of Origin Rioja (66
   vinegars) and Jerez (18 vinegars) according to their chemical
   composition. SIMCA was used, along with cross-validation, as a modelling
   multivariate technique. In order to demonstrate that no better
   sensitivity and specificity of SIMCA can be achieved, a comparison was
   made with the results obtained by using GINN, which is a neural network
   with stochastic learning, which directly optimises both parameters. It
   was found that 92.9\% of the classifications obtained by
   cross-validation with SIMCA were accurate, whereas with GINN 88.7\% were
   correct (median of 10 training steps). The sensitivity and specificity
   obtained with SIMCA were up to 85\% for Rioja vinegars and 95\% for
   Jerez vinegars. The neural network gives higher values than those
   mentioned above for these parameters which confirms their optimal
   character. The modelling and discriminant capacities of the 20 chemical
   variables were also studied.},

Title = {Geographical classification of wine and olive oil by means of
   classification and influence matrix analysis (CAIMAN)},

Abstract = {Classification and influence matrix analysis (CAIMAN) is a new
   classification method, recently proposed and based on the influence
   matrix (also called leverage matrix). Depending on the purposes of the
   classification analysis, CAIMAN can be used in three outlines: (1)
   D-CAIMAN is a discriminant classification method, (2) M-CAIMAN is a
   class modelling method allowing a sample to be classified, not
   classified at all, or assigned to more than one class (confused) and (3)
   A-CAIMAN deals with the asymmetric case, where only a reference class
   needs to be modelled.
   In this work, the geographic classification of samples of wine and olive
   oil has been carried out by means of CAIMAN and its results compared
   with discriminant analysis, by focusing great attention on the model
   predictive capabilities. The geographic characterization has been
   carried out on three different datasets: extra virgin olive oils
   produced in a small area, with a ``protected denomination of origin{''}
   label, wines with different denominations of origin, but produced in
   enclosed geographical areas, and olive oils belonging to different
   production areas.
   Final results seem to indicate that the application of CAIMAN to the
   geographical origin identification offers several advantages: first, it
   shows - on an average basis - good performances; second, it is able to
   deal in a simple way classification problems related to tipicity,
   authenticity, and uniqueness characterization, which are of increasing
   interest in food quality issues. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A computerised approach to vastly reduce the experimental information
   required (number of independent variables) to classify similar extra
   virgin olive oils (EVOOs) is presented. It is based on the application
   of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and further analysis of the obtained
   results using differential calculations. To validate this new model, it
   has been applied for the classification of 147 EVOO samples into four
   similar families. The oil samples employed came from two types of
   protected denomination of origin (PDO) oils and two non-PDO from the
   same Spanish province (Granada). This approach results in a new method
   that reduces the necessary size of the databases used, without an
   appreciable loss of information, by over 82\%. The percentage of
   misclassifications using less data points is similar to the results
   achieved using the whole database (less than 0.90\%).},

Abstract = {Due to geographical indication advantage of Hongmeiren (HMR) citrus,
   economically motivated origin fraud has emerged, alongside significant
   differences in antioxidant components. This study employed benchtop
   visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy combined with machine
   learning models for simultaneously identifying geographical origins and
   quantifying antioxidant components in HMR citrus. Savitzky-Golay and
   area normalization pre-processing exhibited the performance improvement
   in classification and regression models, respectively. Subsequently,
   Boruta algorithm feature selection further improved the both regression
   and classification performance of models. Among these, feedforward
   neural network model achieved the highest classification accuracy (88.7
   \%) for geographical origin, with few misclassified samples (1-2) in
   each origin and an excellent AUC (0.943). It also exhibited highest
   regression effects in quantifying ascorbic acid (R2 = 0.875), total
   phenolics (R2 = 0.856), and total flavonoids (R2 = 0.806). Thus,
   benchtop Vis-NIR spectroscopy offers a practical and efficient multitask

Title = {Extraction and classification of origin characteristic peaks from rice
   Raman spectra by principal component analysis},
Journal = {VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rice origin identification can provide brand protection for rice with
   geographical indications. Therefore, it is necessary to design a
   convenient and fast detection method to meet the demands of the market.
   Based on Raman spectroscopy, this study involved the extraction and
   classification of characteristic spectral peaks of rice grain samples of
   the same cultivar but different places of origin. Raman spectra were
   acquired from 80 samples of rice with four different places of origin
   (Longjing 31 cultivar), and spectral information was extracted for
   analysis. First, the rice spectra were pretreated using a baseline
   correction and range normalization. Second, from the 400- 1600cm- 1 and
   2800- 3200cm-1 spectral region starting from the first four principal
   components of the regression coefficients extracted from principal
   component analysis (PCA), further screening produced eight spectral
   peaks characteristic of the place of origin: 476 cm-1, 867 cm-1,940
   cm-1, 1121 cm-1, 1342 cm-1, 1384 cm-1, 1462 cm-1, and 2914 cm-1. These
   were also assigned to functional groups, revealing subtle differences in
   the nutritional content dependent on place of origin. Third, eight
   characteristic values extracted by PCA were used to establish a
   four-layer 8-9-6-4 (input-hidden-hidden-output) back propagation (BP)
   neural network structure as a rice-origin identification model. Finally,
   the model was used to train 80 rice samples in place-oforigin
   classification, and the average prediction accuracy of the cyclic test
   for the training samples reached 97.5 \% after five epochs; for the
   other four epochs the accuracy ranged from 98.75\%-96.25\%. These
   results show that the model is feasible as a tool for the identification
   of rice types of the same variety and that it can effectively identify
   rice from different areas.},

Title = {Rapid determination of geographical authenticity of Gastrodia elata f.
   glauca using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and deep learning},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {167},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {For quality evaluation of Gastrodia elata f. glauca (GEFG), it's crucial
   to develop an analytical method to determine the geographical origin.
   Herein, 371 GEFGs are collected from five provinces, focusing on
   analysis of dry matter content (DMC), origin identification,
   geographical indication (GI) production area discrimination by using a
   combination of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and deep
   learning, data driven version of soft independent modeling of class
   analogy (DD-SIMCA). A significant difference in DMC of GEFG between
   Yunnan and other origins, which may be related to precipitation,
   altitude, temperature, and soil. The residual neural network (ResNet)
   model based on synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy
   (2DCOS) images has stable performances, its accuracy is 100\%. The
   DD-SIMCA model can differentiate GI production areas of GEFG, while for
   non-GI areas, the model specificity is 71.38\%. This study provides a
   promising approach for GEFG geographical traceability and GI production
   area differentiation.},

   berries by electronic nose},

Abstract = {High-quality Zhongning Goji berries (ZNG) are illegally adulterated in
   the market by adding non-ZNG (NZNG). An accurate, rapid, and effective
   approach for the producing area identification of ZNG is needed to
   protect the geographical indications of Goji berry products and to
   ensure fair trade. Samples from different regions were collected and
   their odors were detected by an electronic nose (E-nose). Principal
   component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), and linear discriminant
   analysis (LDA) were employed to build identification models. The E-nose
   models were further verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS). The identification rates of the PCA, CA, and LDA models were
   91.0\%, 98.9\%, and 100\%, respectively. The PCA and CA models presented
   good results, and the LDA model showed optimum performance. These
   conditions indicate the feasibility of using the E-nose technique for
   ZNG identification. GC-MS analysis revealed differences and similarities
   in total ion current chromatograms between ZNG and NZNG. (C) 2016

Title = {Neural networks allow the automatic verification of the type of flour,
   analysing the starch granule morphology, to ensure the protected
   geographical indication `Galician Bread'},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Quality control of flour is essential to control the quality of bread
   produced from it. We propose a control method based on the morphological
   characteristics of the granules of starch. The automation of the
   identification, segmentation and determination of the average size of
   the granules of starch of each of the cereals that make up a flour, from
   microscopy images, is an essential procedure for producers who want to
   produce bread under the protected geographical indication (PGI)
   `Galician Bread'. This identification and counting procedure, if
   performed manually, is a tedious activity for a trained expert, and is
   very time consuming. Thus, automating this task would streamline the
   process, in addition to saving a great deal of time. This paper
   addresses this problem by using deep learning approaches (Mask R-CNN) to
   predict the type of the granule of starch and its size for the first
   time. The trained models are then evaluated with the same raw microscopy
   images of these granules observed under polarized light, as has been
   previouly used for manual identification and counting. A dataset
   comprising 1308 2564 x 1924-pixel images is analysed. The images contain
   17000 labelled granules of starch for two types of wheat: commercial
   wheat flour from `Castilla' (type 0) and the Galician autochthonous
   flour `Caaveiro' (type 1). The number of samples is approximately the
   same for each class. Instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN (Model II)
   achieved valid results for unseen images, with a categorical global
   accuracy of about 88.6\% and with a discrepancy with respect to the
   areas of the granules as estimated by a human expert of less than 4\%.
   The performance achieved by Mask R-CNN produces a strong correlation
   between the results of an expert and the results of the network,
   confirming the practical validity of our proposal.},

   predict the long-term price based on the weight ranking of 16 factors
   affecting the price by technique for order preference by similarity to
   ideal solution method (TOPSIS). The future price is predicted and
   analyzed, and then based on the empirical results, suggestions are put
   forward for the industry in terms of reducing production capacity,

Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a universal tool to investigate the
   different areas of Earth and environmental sciences. The advancement of
   the implementation capabilities of the optoelectronic devices which are
   long-term-tested in the laboratory and the field and are mounted
   on-board of the remote sensing platforms further improves the capability
   of instruments to acquire information about the Earth and its resources
   in global, regional and local scales. With the start of new high-spatial
   and spectral resolution satellite and aircraft imagery new applications
   for large-scale mapping and monitoring becomes possible. The integration
   with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows a synergistic
   processing of the multi-source spatial and spectral data. Here we
   present the results of a joint project DFNI I01/8 funded by the
   Bulgarian Science Fund focused on the algorithms of the preprocessing
   and the processing spectral data by using the methods of the corrections
   and of the visual and automatic interpretation. The objects of this
   study are lineaments. The lineaments are basically the line features on
   the earth's surface which are a sign of the geological structures. The
   geological lineaments usually appear on the multispectral images like
   lines or edges or linear shapes which is the result of the color
   variations of the surface structures. The basic geometry of a line is
   orientation, length and curve. The detection of the geological
   lineaments is an important operation in the exploration for mineral
   deposits, in the investigation of active fault patterns, in the
   prospecting of water resources, in the protecting people, etc. In this
   study the integrated approach for the detecting of the lineaments is
   applied. It combines together the methods of the visual interpretation
   of various geological and geographical indications in the multispectral
   satellite images, the application of the spatial analysis in GIS and the
   automatic processing of the multispectral images by Canny algorithm,
   Directional Filter and Neural Network. Landsat multispectral images of
   the Eastern Rhodopes in Bulgaria for carrying out the procedure are
   used. Canny algorithm for extracting edges represents series of filters
   (Gaussian, Sobel, etc.) applied to all bands of the image using the free
   IDL source. Directional Filter is applied to sharpen the image in a
   specific preferred direction. Another method is the Neural Network
   algorithm for recognizing lineaments. The lineaments are effectively
   extracted using different methods of automatic. The results from the
   above mentioned methods are compared to the results derived from the
   visual interpretation of satellite images and from the geological map.
   In conclusion, the rosediagrams of the distribution of the geological
   lineaments and the maps of their density are completed.},

Abstract = {Background: Agricultural products in the China-Eu Geographical
   Indications (GIs) Agreement have high quality and added value,
   contributing to the growth of trade between China and the EU. The most
   direct information on GI agricultural products is the geographical
   origin, which reflects the product's quality, reputation, creative
   labor, and economic benefits. It is urgent to develop a series of
   geographical origin authentication analytical techniques to protect the
   good reputation of China's GI agricultural products under the China-EU
   GIs Agreement and the interests of all parties involved. Scope and
   approach: This paper comprehensively summarizes the status of the
   protection of the geographical origin authentication of agricultural
   products on the Chinese side of the China-EU GIs Agreement. In addition,
   future development trends in the field of the geographical origin
   authentication of agricultural products are proposed, to provide new
   perspectives on the protection of GI agricultural products in China. Key
   findings and conclusion: The development of rapid and nondestructive
   techniques, deep learning, portable and intelligent detection equipment,
   and the establishment of testing standard systems are some of the future
   trends in the field of geographical origin authentication of
   agricultural products.},

Abstract = {Colour is one of the most important characteristics of a wine., To
   measure it, the International Organisation for Wine (OIV) proposes the
   use of the so-called CieLab parameters: a{*}, red/green chromaticity;
   b{*}, yellow/blue chromaticity; and L{*}, clarity. However, the need for
   including the psychophysical parameters: C{*}, chroma, H{*}, tone, and
   S{*}, saturation has been suggested by some opinions. The six parameters
   are internationally normalised and they are obtained from the absorption
   spectrum in the visible range.
   The aim of this work is to show the interest of the second option
   through the results of multivariate classification and modelling
   analysis. The models built with only the three CieLab variables showed
   to be insufficient for a good characterisation of the colour of the
   young red wines. When the additional variables C{*}, H{*} and S{*} are
   introduced, the specificity of the UNEQ models for both categories are
   improved, from 48 to 70\% and from 75 to 81\%, respectively.
   The European Community (EC) has defined claret and rose wines, allowing
   the consumption of the first only in Spain. In addition, the EC has
   stated as fraudulent the practice of blending white and red wines to be
   sold as rose wines. Using wines from the denomination of origin Rioja,
   the SIMCA models built with the all six variables rejected the blended
   wines while those built with only three variables did not. (C) 2001

Abstract = {In this work, information contained in near infrared (NIR) spectra of
   honeys with protected geographical indication (PGI) ``Mel de Galicia{''}
   was processed by means of different chemometric techniques to develop an
   authentication system for this high quality food product. Honey spectra
   were obtained in a fast and single way, and they were pretreated by
   means of standard normal variate transformation in order to remove the
   influence of particle size, scattering and other factors, and prior to
   their use as input data. As the first step in chemometric study, display
   techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis
   were applied in order to demonstrate that the NIR data contained useful
   information to develop a pattern recognition classification system to
   authenticate honeys with PGI. The second step consisted in the
   application of different pattern recognition techniques (such as D-PLS:
   Discriminant partial least squares regression; SIMCA: Soft independent
   modelling of class analogy; KNN: K-nearest neighbours; and MLF-NN:
   Multilayer feedforward neural networks) to derive diverse models for
   PGI-honey class with the objective of detecting possible falsification
   of these high-quality honeys. Amongst all the classification chemometric
   procedures, SIMCA achieved to be the best PGI-model with 93.3\% of
   sensitivity and 100\% of specificity. Therefore, the combination of NIR
   information data with SIMCA developed a single and fast method in order
   to differentiate between genuine PGI-Galician honey samples and other
   commercial honey samples from other origins that, due to their lower
   price, could be used as substrates for falsification of genuine PGI
   ones. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted and carried out as a consequence of the
   European directives n degrees 2081/92 and n degrees 2037/93 in which
   regulations for the protection of denomination of origin of food
   commodities were established. The research work was intended to
   investigate if monovarietal oils may be differentiated by their basic
   chemical composition. A positive outcome of this pilot study would
   hopefully permit extension to the characterisation of Italian DOP
   (Protected Denomination of Origin) olive oils.
   In the olive, long-chain alcohols, triterpenes and fatty adds, formed in
   distinct biosynthetic compartments, provide characteristic compositional
   data of an olive cultivar. The three classes of compounds were
   qualitatively and quantitatively determined by GC in six Italian olive
   cultivars, Coratina and Provenzale from Puglia, Frantoio and Moraiolo
   from Toscana, Bosana from Sardegna and Dritta from Abruzzo. Basic
   statistics and multivariate methods were first applied to the GC data of
   each class of compounds and then to the complete set of data with the
   aim of obtaining a clear discrimination of the cultivars.
   When Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was applied to the whole set of
   data consisting of alcohols, triterpenes and acids, the PCA revealed
   that the compounds (variables) that gave the better class distinction
   were: cycloartenol for Coratina, acids C20:0, C17:0, C18:0 for Dritta,
   citrostadienol for Frantoio and p-sitosterol for Moraiolo. Bosana and
   Provenzale correlated with erythrodiol and uvaol. A correct assignment
   of each oil sample to its monovarietal group was obtained.},

Abstract = {Mislabeling and adulteration are problems in the food industry.
   Considering the frequent occurrence of safety affairs in agricultural
   products, it is necessary to establish a traceability system for the
   quality and safety of agricultural products. The aim of the present
   study was to establish a rapid detection method for distinguishing rice
   samples from ten different products of geographical indication in China
   using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). A support vector
   machine (SVM) is used to calculate the recognition rate of single
   spectral lines and multi-spectral lines of the geographic origins of
   rice. The adjusting spectral weighting of the multi-spectral line
   composition of mineral metal elements is higher, which can effectively
   improve the identification rate of the origin of the rice. The results
   show that the classification accuracies of single spectral line
   recognition and multi-spectral line recognition are 90.8 and 94.6\%,
   respectively. It can be concluded that the LIBS technique combined with
   SVM should be a promising tool for rapidly distinguishing different
   geographic origins of rice.},

Title = {Deep Learning Model for Soil Environment Quality Classification of
   Pu-erh Tea},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Pu-erh tea, Camellia sinensis is a traditional Chinese tea, one of the
   black teas, originally produced in China's Yunnan Province, named after
   its origin and distribution center in Pu-erh, Yunnan. Yunnan Pu-erh tea
   is protected by geographical Indication and has unique quality
   characteristics. It is made from Yunnan large-leaf sun-green tea with
   specific processing techniques. The quality formation of Pu-erh tea is
   closely related to the soil's environmental conditions. In this paper,
   time-by-time data of the soil environment of tea plantations during the
   autumn tea harvesting period in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan
   Province, China, in 2021 were analyzed. Spearman's correlation analysis
   was conducted between the inner components of Pu'er tea and the soil
   environmental factor. The analysis showed that three soil environmental
   indicators, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH, were highly
   significantly correlated. The soil environmental quality evaluation
   method was proposed based on the selected soil environmental
   characteristics. Meanwhile, a deep learning model of Long Short Term
   Memory (LSTM) Network for the soil environmental quality of tea
   plantation was established according to the proposed method, and the
   soil environmental quality of tea was classified into four classes. In
   addition, the paper also compares the constructed models based on BP
   neural network and random forest to evaluate the coefficient of
   determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE),
   mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE)
   of the indicators for comparative analysis. This paper innovatively
   proposes to introduce the main inclusions of Pu'er tea into the
   classification and discrimination model of the soil environment in tea
   plantations, while using machine learning-related algorithms to classify
   and predict the categories of soil environmental quality, instead of
   relying solely on statistical data for analysis. This research work
   makes it possible to quickly and accurately determines the physiological
   status of tea leaves based on the establishment of a soil environment
   quality prediction model, which provides effective data for the
   intelligent management of tea plantations and has the advantage of rapid
   and low-cost assessment compared with the need to measure the intrinsic
   quality of Pu-erh tea after harvesting is completed.},

Abstract = {The Senise red pepper, known as peperone crusco, is a protected
   geographical indication (PGI) product from Basilicata, Italy,
   traditionally consumed dried. Producers use semi-open greenhouses to
   meet PGI standards, but significant losses are caused by rot from
   microorganisms thriving in high moisture, temperature, and humidity,
   which also encourage pest infestations. To minimize losses, a low-cost
   alert system was developed. The study, conducted in summer 2022 and
   2023, used external parameters from the ALSIA Senise weather station and
   internal sensors monitoring the air temperature and humidity inside the
   greenhouse. Since rot is complex and difficult to model, an artificial
   intelligence (AI)-based approach was adopted. A feed forward neural
   network (FFNN) estimated greenhouse climate conditions as if it were
   empty, comparing them with actual values when peppers were present. This
   revealed the most critical period was the first 3-4 days after
   introduction and identified a critical air relative humidity threshold.
   The system could also predict microclimatic parameters inside the
   greenhouse with red peppers, issuing warnings one hour before risk
   conditions arose. In 2023, it was tested by comparing predicted values
   with previously identified thresholds. When critical levels were
   exceeded, greenhouse operators were alerted to adjust conditions. In
   2023, pepper rot decreased.},

Abstract = {Adulteration is widespread in the herbal and food industry and seriously
   restricts traditional Chinese medicine development. Accurate
   identification of geo-authentic herbs ensures drug safety and
   effectiveness. In this study, H-1 NMR combined intelligent
   ``rotation-invariant uniform local binary pattern{''} identification was
   implemented for the geographical origin confirmation of geo-authentic
   Chinese yam (grown in Jiaozuo, Henan province) from Chinese yams grown
   in other locations. Our results showed that the texture feature of H-1
   NMR image extracted with rotation-invariant uniform local binary pattern
   for identification is far superior compared to the original NMR data.
   Furthermore, data preprocessing is necessary. Moreover, the model
   combining a feature extraction algorithm and support vector machine
   (SVM) classifier demonstrated good robustness. This approach is
   advantageous, as it is accurate, rapid, simple, and inexpensive. It is
   also suitable for the geographical origin traceability of other
   geographical indication agricultural products.},

Title = {Class-modelling techniques that optimize the probabilities of false
   noncompliance and false compliance},
Journal = {CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {103},
Number = {1},
Pages = {25-42},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {The work presents two approaches for the construction of empirical
   class-models for a given category C. The attention is centred on the
   information provided by the sensitivity and specificity, the two usual
   parameters employed to qualify a class-model. In fact, not only a
   class-model is built for C but a set of class-models which differ in
   their sensitivity and specificity. Therefore the range of possible
   jointly available values is described, allowing the user to select the
   model that best adapt to specific situations or particular needs.
   One of the approaches, PLS-CM (Partial Least Squares Class-Modelling),
   is based on the modelling of the distribution of the values obtained by
   a PLS model fitted with binary response (belong/do not belong to C). In
   that way, the corresponding hypothesis test permits the computation of
   the probabilities alpha and beta of type land type II errors when
   deciding whether a sample belongs to C. These probabilities, expressed
   as percentages, are 100 minus sensitivity and 100 minus specificity,
   respectively. The representation of beta versus alpha is the risk curve
   that describes the PLS-CM capability of modelling category C.
   The other approach comes from setting the problem as a multi-objective
   optimization problem, the one that corresponds to simultaneously
   maximize sensitivity and specificity, which usually behave oppositely.
   The trading-off solutions (again, different class-models) are computed
   to be Pareto-optimal solutions, that is, the set of the optimal
   solutions in at least one of the conflicting objectives, what is known
   as the Pareto-optimal front, POF.
   Additionally, a procedure to cross-validate the risk curve and the
   Pareto-optimal front is proposed for the first time in order to evaluate
   the prediction ability of both methods.
   Two case-studies are used to drive the discussion: 1) the
   characterization of wines that official wine-tasters regarded as
   compliant ones according to the quality characteristics stated by a
   Denomination of Origin and 2) The characterization of breast tumours
   defined as benign (compliant class) from 9 cytological variables.
   Finally, the performance of the methods is tested using several data
   sets from the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Beijing-you chicken (BJY) is a classic chicken breed originating from
   the Beijing area. BJY is popular among the local people and faces the
   risk of counterfeiting in the market. In this study, hyperspectral
   imaging in tandem with multivariate analyses were employed to identify
   and authenticate BJY among four common chicken breeds. Images of chicken
   breasts (50 each) were collected in the near-infrared range (900-1,700
   nm) and five pretreatment methods were implemented individually after
   spectra extraction. Different combinations of pretreatments and grouping
   methods were used with two statistical classifiers (k-nearest neighbor
   and support vector machine) before and after feature wavelength
   selection using successive projections algorithm. Finally, a
   comparatively satisfactory result was achieved, and the accuracies
   reached 100\% for the calibration set and 92\% for the prediction set,
   in which BJY could almost be identified with a 98\% accuracy rate. The
   results indicated that the hyperspectral imaging technique was a
   promising method for industrial applications to address fraud in
   determining chicken breeds. Practical Applications Beijing-you chicken
   is a precious breed of chicken in China that has been applied for
   geographical indication products. The protection of this variety can
   provide theoretical basis and technical support for the division of
   geographical indications. Therefore, a fast and effective identification
   method is needed for the classification of Beijing-you chicken breed.
   Hyperspectral imaging is a popular method for varieties classification.
   In our study, the satisfying results revealed that this method could be
   used for classification of Beijing-you chicken when necessary. The
   results will be useful for the application of hyperspectral imaging
   technology in the classification of Beijing-you chicken. Moreover, this
   method has great potential for real-time online detection in factories
   for future work.},

Title = {Fingerprinting black tea: When spectroscopy meets machine learning a
   novel workflow for geographical origin identification},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {438},
Month = {APR 16},
Abstract = {Food fraud, along with many challenges to the integrity and
   sustainability, threatens the prosperity of businesses and society as a
   whole. Tea is the second most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage
   globally. Challenges to tea authenticity require the development of
   highly efficient and rapid solutions to improve supply chain
   transparency. This study has produced an innovative workflow for black
   tea geographical indications (GI) discrimination based on non-targeted
   spectroscopic fingerprinting techniques. A total of 360 samples
   originating from nine GI regions worldwide were analysed by Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Near Infrared spectroscopy. Machine
   learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbours and support vector machine
   models) applied to the test data greatly improved the GI identification
   achieving 100\% accuracy using FTIR. This workflow will provide a
   low-cost and user-friendly solution for on-site and real-time
   determination of black tea geographical origin along supply chains.},

Journal = {NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD},
Year = {2021},

Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Identification of geographical origin is of great importance for
   protecting the authenticity of valuable agri-food products with
   designated origins. In this study, a robust and accurate analytical
   method that could authenticate the geographical origin of Geographical
   Indication (GI) products was developed. The method was based on
   elemental profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
   (ICP-MS) in combination with machine learning techniques for model
   building and feature selection. The method successfully predicted and
   classified six varieties of Chinese GI rice. The elemental profiles of
   131 rice samples were determined, and two machine learning algorithms
   were implemented, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF),
   together with the feature selection algorithm Relief. Prediction
   accuracy of 100\% was achieved by both Relief-SVM and Relief-RF models,
   using only four elements (Al, B, Rb, and Na). The methodology and
   knowledge from this study could be used to develop reliable methods for
   tracing geographical origins and controlling fraudulent labeling of
   diverse high-value agri-food products.},

Title = {Rapid and Nondestructive Discrimination of Geographical Origins of
   Longjing Tea using Hyperspectral Imaging at Two Spectral Ranges Coupled

Abstract = {Longjing tea is one of China's protected geographical indication
   products with high commercial and nutritional value. The geographical
   origin of Longjing tea is an important factor influencing its commercial
   and nutritional value. Hyperspectral imaging systems covering the two
   spectral ranges of 380-1030 nm and 874-1734 nm were used to identify a
   single tea leaf of Longjing tea from six geographical origins. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) was conducted on hyperspectral images to form
   PCA score images. Differences among samples from different geographical
   origins were visually observed from the PCA score images. Support vector
   machine (SVM) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)
   models were built using the full spectra at the two spectral ranges.
   Decent classification performances were obtained at the two spectral
   ranges, with the overall classification accuracy of the calibration and
   prediction sets over 84\%. Furthermore, prediction maps for geographical
   origins identification of Longjing tea were obtained by applying the SVM
   models on the hyperspectral images. The overall results illustrate that
   hyperspectral imaging at both spectral ranges can be applied to identify
   the geographical origin of single tea leaves of Longjing tea. This study
   provides a new, rapid, and non-destructive alternative for Longjing tea
   geographical origins identification.},

Abstract = {Brandy de Jerez is a unique spirit produced in Southern Spain under
   Protected Geographical Indication ``Brandy de Jerez{''} (PGI). Two key
   factors for the production of quality brandies are the original wine
   spirit and its aging process. They are significantly conditioned by
   specific variables related to the base wine and the distillation method
   employed to produce the wine spirit used to obtain a finally aged
   brandy. This final beverage is therefore strongly influenced by its
   production process. The chromatographic instrumental fingerprints
   (obtained by GC FID) of the major volatile fraction of a series of
   brandies have been examined by applying a chemometric approach based on
   unsupervised (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component
   analysis) and supervised pattern recognition tools (partial least
   squares-discriminant analysis and support vector machine). This approach
   was able to identify the fermentation conditions of the original wine,
   the distillation method used to produce the wine spirit, and the aging
   process as the most influential factors on the volatile profile.},

Title = {Geographic Origin Discrimination of Millet Using Vis-NIR Spectroscopy
   Combined with Machine Learning Techniques},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Millet is a primary food for people living in the dry and semi-dry
   regions and is dispersed within most parts of Europe, Africa, and Asian
   countries. As part of the European Union (EU) efforts to establish food
   originality, there is a global need to create Protected Geographical
   Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) of crops and
   agricultural products to ensure the integrity of the food supply. In the
   present work, Visible and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (Vis-NIR) combined
   with machine learning techniques was used to discriminate 16 millet
   varieties (n = 480) originating from various regions of China. Five
   different machine learning algorithms, namely, K-nearest neighbor
   (K-NN), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Logistic regression (LR),
   Random Forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM), were used to train
   the NIR spectra of these millet samples and to assess their
   discrimination performance. Visible cluster trends were obtained from
   the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the spectral data.
   Cross-validation was used to optimize the performance of the models.
   Overall, the F-Score values were as follows: SVM with 99.5\%,
   accompanied by RF with 99.5\%, LDA with 99.5\%, K-NN with 99.1\%, and LR
   with 98.8\%. Both the linear and non-linear algorithms yielded positive
   results, but the non-linear models appear slightly better. The study
   revealed that applying Vis-NIR spectroscopy assisted by machine learning
   technique can be an essential tool for tracing the origins of millet,
   contributing to a safe authentication method in a quick, relatively
   cheap, and non-destructive way.},

Abstract = {Gastrodia elata Bl (G. elata), a medicinal and edible homologous

   combined with chemometrics {[}Principal component analysis (PCA),
   Partial least squares discrimination (PLS-DA), Support vector machines
   (SVM), and Data-driven soft independent modeling of class analogy

   and non-geographical indications of G. elata. PLS-DA, after the
   application of SNV+SD spectral preprocessing, achieved 100\% accuracy on
   the training set and 88.89\% on the test set, respectively. Under SG+SD
   conditions, SVM outperformed PLS-DA with 100\% training set accuracy and
   94.74\% for the test set. A ResNet model that used synchronous 2DCOS
   data successfully distinguished G. elata from Yunnan and Guizhou,
   achieving 100\% accuracy across training, test, and external validation
   sets. These findings support that ATR-FTIR and chemometrics can be
   utilized to effectively identify the geographical origin of G. elata,

Abstract = {Discriminating wines according to their denomination of origin using
   cost-effective techniques is something that attracts the attention of
   different industrial sectors. In search of simplicity, direct UV-visible
   spectrophotometric techniques and different multivariate statistical
   techniques are used with admissible results to characterize wine
   produced in specific regions. However, most of the reported
   classification methods do not exploit all of the statistical relations
   in the investigated dataset and are inherently affected by the presence
   of outliers. The aim of this paper is to test novel classification
   methods such as support vector machines as a means of improving the
   classification rate when UV-visible spectrophotometric methods are used
   to discriminate wines. The advantages of such a discrimination tool are
   demonstrated when classification rates are compared for a large number
   of Spanish red and white wines and classification rates above 96\% are
   achieved. The proposed methodology also enables the selection of the
   most relevant wavelengths for sample discrimination. The proposed
   methodology also enables the selection of the most relevant wavelengths

Abstract = {Synchronous fluorescence (SF) spectra measured at constant wavelength
   differences from 10 nm to 100 nm in the excitation wavelength range
   250-350 nm and pattern-recognition methods were used for searching the
   natural grouping among Slovak juniper-flavoured spirit drinks. The best
   result was achieved using SF spectra recorded at a constant wavelength
   difference of 10 nm. Supervised methods were used to classify samples
   considering two types of classification criteria: distinguishing between
   drinks from different producers or distillates of different geographical
   indications and others. The supervised methods were based on two
   different data sets: the first principal components of the principal
   component analysis performed on the SF spectra and the SF spectra.
   Linear discriminant analysis was applied to the first principal
   components. General discriminant analysis (GDA), k-nearest neighbour
   (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to SF spectra.
   Regarding different producers, both use of both GDA and SVM resulted in
   100\% correct classification. Regarding geographical indiciation, 100\%

Title = {Identification of geographical origin of winter jujube based on GC-MS
   coupled with machine-learning algorithms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {124},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas
   chromatography-mass (GC-MS) is the most often used technique for the
   analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). When coupled with
   machine-learning algorithms, the two provide the means to differentiate
   the volatile metabolome of foods from different origins. In this study,
   the volatile metabolites of winter jujube, a fruit protected by China
   and the European Union (EU) based on geographical indications (GI), was
   analyzed by HS-SPME-GC-MS. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was
   applied, for the first time, to evaluate differences in winter jujube
   grown in four distinct regions. Locational differences yielded 33 VOCs
   that differed by functionality and concentration with a recurrence
   probability of >= 60\%. Zhanhua winter jujube contained the most
   abundant VOCs, with Yuncheng winter jujube the least. The 33 winter
   jujube VOCs were analyzed by random forest (RF), support vector machine
   (SVM), and XGBoost to identify the place of origin. The discrimination
   rates were about 85\% using RF, about 93\% using SVM, and about 98\%
   with XGBoost. Compared to RF and SVM algorithms, XGBoost was more
   efficient, pro-ducing higher accuracy rates, and providing new
   opportunities for origin traceability.},

Abstract = {Banganapalle is one of the most common and popular subspecies of Mango
   in India and an geographical indication of Indian state Andhra Pradesh.
   Mango being a senescent type fruits spontaneously goes into the
   senescent stage within a few days depending upon its harvest time
   ripeness. In this work, two non-destructive schemes are presented to
   assess the ripening stage of a Banganapalle mango and to predict the
   number of days left for it to enter the senescent stage. The first
   scheme uses electrical equivalent model parameters of Banganapalle
   mangoes to assess the ripeness. The parameter values are estimated from
   electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using ZView software. The second
   scheme directly uses the EIS data after reducing it by principle
   component analysis (PCA). For both schemes, two different machine
   learning (ML) classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and
   k-nearest neighbour (KNN) are used and their performances are compared.
   It is found that the KNN classifier on PCA-reduced EIS data provides the
   highest true positive rate (TPR) and F1 score (0.86) in detecting the
   stage of ripening based on 582 measurements on 28 samples. Proposed
   techniques are validated using ethylene data for reference.},

Abstract = {The designation of origin for coffee establishes a connection between a
   product's unique origin and quality. In this context, this study
   investigated 25 bioactive compounds, including polyphenols and organic
   acids, as potential markers for authenticating coffee origin. Brazilian
   coffees from four regions with protected designation of origin status
   were evaluated. The compounds were quantified using High Performance
   Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detection (HPLC-DAD), and
   classification performance was assessed using Partial Least Squares
   Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Soft Independent Modeling by Class
   Analogy (SIMCA), and Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM).
   LS-SVM produced the best results, with 100 \% sensitivity, 83-100 \%
   selectivity, and 97-100 \% accuracy when classifying the origins. The
   bioactive compounds that most influenced class discrimination were
   p-coumaric, malonic, rosmarinic, and formic acids. Overall, these
   findings suggest that bioactive compounds can serve as biomarkers for
   authenticating coffees with different designations of origin, thereby
   helping to prevent fraud and ensure product traceability.},

Abstract = {In today's global food markets, the ability to trace the origins of
   agricultural products is becoming increasingly important. We developed
   an efficient procedure for validating the authenticity and origin of tea
   samples where Partial Least Squares and Euclidean Distance methods,
   based on near-infrared spectroscopy data, were combined to classify tea
   samples from different tea producing areas. Four models for
   identification of authenticity of tea samples were constructed and
   utilized in our two-step procedure. High accuracy rates of 98.60\%,
   97.90\%, 97.55\%, and 99.83\% for the calibration set, and 97.19\%,
   97.54\%, 97.83\%, 100\% for test set, were achieved. After the first
   identification step, employing the four origin authenticity models,
   followed by the second step using the Euclidean Distance method,
   accuracy rates for specific origin identification were 98.43\% in the
   calibration set and 96.84\% in the test set. This method, employing
   two-step analysis of multi-origin model, accurately identified the
   origin of tea samples collected in four different areas. This study
   provided a potential reference method for the detection of
   ``geographical indication{''} of agricultural products' and is available
   for use in traceability of origin studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The aims were to determine the polyphenolic profile of red wines from
   Spanish Designation of Origin (DO) Rias Baixas and Ribeira Sacra and to
   evaluate the feasibility of using polyphenolic profiles and chemometric
   tools to classify wines for authentication purposes. Trans-resveratrol,
   oenin, malvin, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, quercetin and syringic
   acid were determined in 39 samples. Soft independent modeling of class
   analogy (SIMCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector
   machine classification (SVM) were used to classify. For resveratrol,
   Ribeira Sacra red wines showed higher values than Rias Baixas wines
   (4.60 and 3.36 mg L-1, respectively). SVM classification was adequate
   for 100 \% classification of wines by their polyphenolic profile. SIMCA
   classification was also adequate for wine classification of DO Rias
   Baixas and Ribeira Sacra wines. As conclusion, polyphenolic profile can
   be used for classification of DOs. The models can discriminate outside
   wines. Thus, this approach can be useful for authentication purposes.},

Abstract = {Reliable origin certification methods are essential for the protection
   of high-value genuine medicinal material with designated origins and
   geographical indication (GI) products. Aconiti Lateralis Radix
   Praeparata (Fuzi), one well-known traditional Chinese medicine and
   geographical indication products have remarkable efficacy and wide
   clinical application, with high demand in domestic and international
   markets. The efficacy and price of Fuzi from different origins vary, and
   it is difficult for the general public to accurately identify them
   through traditional experience. The mass spectrometry detection
   technology based on the plant metabolomics is tedious and lengthy in
   test sample preparation, complicated in operation, long in detection
   time, and low in reproducibility. As a sophisticated, green, fast, and
   low-loss detection technique, infrared spectroscopy is integrated by
   machine learning to bring new ways for quality regulation and control of
   traditional Chinese medicines. An analytical method based on
   mid-infrared spectroscopy combined with a random forest algorithm was
   developed to verify the geographical origin of authentic herbs and/or GI
   products. The method successfully predicted and classified three
   varieties of Chinese GI Fuzi and four varieties of non-GI Fuzi. In this
   study, an environment-friendly traceability strategy with fast analysis,
   low sample loss and high precision was used to provide a new strategy
   for identifying the origin of Fuzi.},

Title = {What Determinants Will Enhance or Constrain the Spatiality of
   Agricultural Products with Geographical Indications in Northeast China?
   An Interpretable Learning Approach},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Geographical indication (GI) offers a unique protection scheme to
   preserve high-quality agricultural products and support rural
   sustainability at the territorial level. However, not all the areas with
   traditional agricultural products are acknowledged with a GI.
   Quantifying the contribution of each factor to geographical indication
   agricultural products (GIAPs) can facilitate the formulation of
   effective policies to improve rural livelihoods. In this study, the
   random forest (RF) model was applied to investigate the contribution of
   multi-perspective factors, including nature, society, agriculture and
   market, on the distribution of GIAPs, and examined the driving causes
   using interpretable approaches. The empirical findings demonstrate that
   the RF model is able to accurately capture most of the important factors
   characterizing GIAPs and to make out-of-sample predictions of the study
   units which obtain GIs. This study revealed that natural conditions and
   market demand were contributing aspects to the disparity of GIAPs in
   Northeast China. The order of determinants was the category of online
   GIAPs (CatOn) > the number of online GIAPs (NumOn) > the area of black
   soil (BlaSoil) > the distance to offline stores selling GIAPs (DisOff).
   Of these, GIAPs was lower than ybase in parts of districts of Jilin and
   Heilongjiang Provinces when the area of black soil (BlaSoil) gradually
   increased. When the category and number of online GIAPs (CatOn and
   NumOn) were less than 20 and 5, respectively, GIAPs were enhanced,
   especially for 40\% of the districts in Liaoning Province. Deepening
   understanding of GIAPs helps to better target and tailor sustainable
   development policies.},

Title = {Are the Adivasi Rice Growers of Sub-Himalayan North Bengal Efficient
   Enough? Role of Machine Learning in Farm Business After COVID-19},
Journal = {GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 31},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown have disrupted the
   farming communities across the planet; however, the indigenous
   communities such as the Adivasi people of tea garden areas in India have
   been hit hard. It becomes more crucial when we talk about marginalized
   communities. In India, the Adivasi tribe found in the sub-Himalayan
   North Bengal cultivates folk rice that needs immediate energy-efficient
   measures as the production has been increased after receiving the
   geographical indication tag. Energy efficiency estimation often applied
   a two-step data envelopment analysis model in agricultural production.
   However, in most of the previous articles, the applications discussed
   the factors affecting energy use efficiency with rare studies on
   efficiency prediction. In this article, first, data envelopment analysis
   was used to estimate the energy efficiency of rice growers, and in the
   second stage, extreme gradient boosting, a state-of-the-art machine
   learning algorithm, was employed to derive the key leading efficiency
   determinants. The findings revealed wide variation among efficient and
   inefficient rice growers in the first stage and derived the most salient
   factors predicting energy efficiency in the second stage. The optimal
   use of energy inputs combined with effective education, better credit
   delivery mechanism, arable land availability and years of farming
   experience provided improvement for the future energy use efficiency of
   the Adivasi farmers. Further, the novel application of extreme gradient
   boosting as a machine learning algorithm in energy efficiency evaluation
   suggests decision-making solutions with a prediction accuracy of
   80.91\%. Moreover, this study aims to assist future researchers in
   examining and predicting the key leading determinants to affect energy
   utilization.},

Title = {Genetic Characterization of the Local Pirenaica Cattle for Parentage and
   Traceability Purposes},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simple Summary
   Domestic livestock diversity is an important component of global
   biodiversity and molecular data have become essential for the
   characterization of genetic diversity in cattle. The aim of this study
   was to assess the effectiveness of a 30-short tandem repeat (STR) panel
   and reveal the genetic structure of a local Pirenaica breed compared
   with other breeds (Terrena, Blonde d'Aquitaine, Limousin, Salers and
   Holstein-Friesian) typically raised in the same geographic Basque
   region. The proposed STR panel could be used as an appropriate genetic
   tool to trace Pirenaica animals and their Protected Geographic
   Indication (PGI) products.
   Pirenaica is the most important autochthonous cattle breed within the
   Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) beef quality label in the Basque
   region, in northern Spain. The short tandem repeats (STRs) are powerful
   markers to elucidate forensic cases and traceability across the
   agri-food sector. The main objective of the present work was to study
   the phylogenetic relationships of Pirenaica cattle and other breeds
   typically raised in the region and provide the minimum number of STR
   markers for parentage and traceability purposes. The 30-STR panel
   recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics-Food and
   Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (ISAG-FAO) was compared
   against other commercial STR panels. The 30-STR panel showed a combined
   matching probability of 1.89 x 10(-25) and a power of exclusion for duos
   of 0.99998. However, commercial STR panels showed a limited efficiency
   for a reliable parentage analysis in Pirenaica, and at least a 21-STR
   panel is needed to reach a power of exclusion of 0.9999.
   Machine-learning analysis also demonstrated a 95\% accuracy in
   assignments selecting the markers with the highest F-ST in Pirenaica
   individuals. Overall, the present study shows the genetic
   characterization of Pirenaica and its phylogeny compared with other
   breeds typically raised in the Basque region. Finally, a 21-STR panel
   with the highest F-ST markers is proposed for a confident parentage
   analysis and high traceability.},

Abstract = {Life is fundamentally unequal, shaped by the arbitrary circumstances of
   birth and fate. The chapter critically explores the role of intellectual
   property (IP) law within the framework of meritocracy, arguing that
   meritocratic IP can provide effective incentives to fostering
   creativity, commerce, and innovation, to move up one's position in
   society and change the culture in the process. However, meritocratic IP
   should not be used to justify or perpetuate inequality. IP rights,
   copyright, patents, trademarks, geographical indications (GIs), cultural
   heritage rights (CHR), and trade secrets, are analyzed for their
   meritocratic value and their potential to either exacerbate or mitigate
   inequality. The digital transformation and the rise of artificial
   intelligence (AI) present new challenges, where creative destruction may
   widen income inequality while also lowering resource inequality by
   increasing access to goods and services. Additionally, the spatial and
   cultural dimensions of IP, particularly in the context of GIs and CHRs,
   are examined for how they can entrench existing disparities. The chapter
   advocates for a recalibration of IP law that better aligns with true
   meritocratic principles while ensuring that it does not reinforce
   inequality. It calls for a more flexible and inclusive IP system that
   respects both the heritage of the past and the innovation of the future,
   ultimately aiming to create a society where meritocracy drives inclusive
   progress and shared prosperity rather than entrenched inequities.},

Title = {Predicting agri-food quality across space: A Machine Learning model for
   the acknowledgment of Geographical Indications},
Journal = {FOOD POLICY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {112},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Geographical Indications (GIs), as Protected Designation of Origin
   (PDO)and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), offer a unique
   protection scheme to preserve high-quality agri-food productions and
   support sustainable rural development at the territorial level. However,
   not all the areas with traditional agri-food products are acknowledged
   with a GI. Examining the Italian wine sector by a geo-referenced
   database and a machine learning framework, we show that municipalities
   which obtain a GI within the subsequent 10 year period (2002-2011) can
   be predicted using a large set of (lagged) municipality-level data
   (1981-2001). We find that the Random Forest algorithm is the best model
   to make out-of-sample predictions of municipalities which obtain GIs.
   Results show that there is a sort of optimal territorial condition
   characterized by the successful matching of wine-growing profession
   (vineyards), local actors involved (number of farmers), and physical
   dimension of farms (middle farms). Being in a vital economic system and
   the distance from major urban centers also emerges among the main
   relevant features in predicting the success of GIs. The methodology
   adopted and the evidence provided lead to policy reflections, in the
   light of the future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming period
   and the scheduled reform of the GI's quality scheme.},

Title = {Laser-based classification of olive oils assisted by machine learning},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Olive oil is an essential diet component in all Mediterranean countries
   having a considerable impact on the local economies, which are producing
   almost 90\% of the world production. Therefore, the quality assessment
   of olive oil in terms of its acidity and its authentication in terms of
   PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical
   Indications) characterizations are nowadays necessary and of great
   importance for the market of olive oil and the related economic
   activities. In the present work, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
   (LIBS) is used assisted by machine learning algorithms for retrieving of
   the information contained in the LIBS spectra to provide a simple,
   reliable, and ultrafast methodology for olive oils classification in
   terms of the degree of acidity and geographical origin. The combination
   of LIBS technique with machine learning statistical analysis approaches
   constitute a very powerful tool for the fast, in-situ and remote quality
   control of olive oil.},

Abstract = {The current study aims to develop a PAN India database of medicinal
   plants along with their phytochemicals and geographical availability.
   The database consists of 6959 unique medicinal plants belonging to 348
   families which are available across 28 states and 8 union territories of
   India. The database sources the information on four different sections -
   traditional knowledge, geographical indications, phytochemicals, and
   chemoinformatics. The traditional knowledge reports the plant taxonomy
   with their vernacular names. A total of 27,440 unique phytochemicals
   associated with these plants were curated from various sources in this
   study. However, due to the non-availability of general information like
   IUPAC names, InChI key, etc. from reliable sources, only 22,314
   phytochemicals have been currently reported in the database. Various
   analyses have been performed for the phytochemicals which include
   analysis of physicochemical and ADMET properties calculated from
   open-source web servers using in-house python scripts. The phytochemical
   data set has also been classified based on the class, superclass, and
   pathways respectively using NPClassifier, a deep learning framework.
   Additionally, the antiviral potency of the phytochemicals was also
   predicted using two machine learning models - Random Forest and XGBoost.
   The database aims to provide accurate and exhaustive data of the
   traditional practice of medicinal plants in India in a single platform
   integrating and analyzing the rich customary practices and facilitating
   the development and identification of plant-based therapeutics for a
   variety of diseases. The database can be accessed at

Abstract = {Traceability and mislabelling of black tea for their geographical origin
   is known as a major fraud concern of the sector. Discrimination among
   various geographical indications (GIs) can be challenging due to the
   complexity of chemical fingerprints in multi-class metabolomics
   analysis. In this study, 302 black tea samples from 9 main cultivation
   GI regions were collected. A comprehensive non-targeted fingerprinting
   workflow was built on liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry (LC-QToF), and a comparison between conventional
   chemometrics modelling and machine learning was performed. 229 and 145
   metabolites were selected as biomarkers and the model
   robustness/performance were further validated through internal 7-fold
   crossvalidation and external validation, showing 100 \% accuracy for
   discriminating GI origin on both. This research provided a novel
   solution to enhance transparency and traceability in the black tea
   supply chain for lab scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed biomarker
   selection workflow revealed more insights for future machine
   learning-derived non-targeted metabolomics research.},

Title = {Metabolomics for origin traceability of lamb: An ensemble learning
   approach based on random forest recursive feature elimination},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY-X},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {29},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The origin traceability of lamb is a longstanding concern for consumers.
   Despite the widespread application of untargeted metabolomics in meat
   origin traceability, challenges remain in achieving rapid and accurate
   identification of biomarkers. This study utilized untargeted
   metabolomics to analyse five breeds of geographical indication lamb,
   obtaining profile data comprising a total of 4139 metabolites. Using
   random forest recursive feature elimination, 29 potential biomarkers
   were initially identified, which showed significant breed-specific and
   production environment-related variations. Upon further assessment, a
   refined panel of 14 metabolic biomarkers demonstrated optimal accuracy
   and robustness in tracing lamb origin. When combined with the Naive
   Bayes algorithm, these biomarkers yielded the highest classification
   accuracy among all evaluated machine learning methods. The random forest
   recursive feature elimination presents a practical approach for handling
   high-dimensional metabolomics datasets compared to previous analytical
   methods. These findings also provide valuable insights into the
   development of machine learning-based biomarker panels, greatly
   enhancing the breed-specific traceability of lamb.},

   on chemical composition combined with chemometric},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1676},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is protected by Geographical
   Indications as harvested roots have different regional characteristics.
   The aim of this study was to distinguish 95 American ginseng samples
   from four origins (including America, Canada, Shandong province and the
   Northeast provinces in China), and to further discriminate samples
   harvested within the protected designation of origin (PDO) from those
   harvested in non-PDO regions. Two metabolomic methods were used to
   acquire qualitative data on the metabolites of American ginseng samples
   from different origins, namely high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) and headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS).
   There were significant differences in numerous metabolites, including
   volatile compounds and ginsenosides. American ginsengs from four
   different regions were discriminated based on 25 volatile compounds and
   8 ginsenosides using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which had a
   96.8\% accuracy and a 74.7\% cross validation rate, and random forest
   (RF) modeling, which reached 100\% accuracy using the training set and
   92.9\% accuracy using the testing set. The same 33 analytes combined
   with LDA and RF were compared for discrimination of PDO and non-PDO
   samples. The 100\% accuracy was again obtained using the RF model, but
   only when using data from both HS-GC-MS and HPLC. The result showed that
   chemical composition combined with chemometric is effectively and
   accurately to study the origins of American ginseng.(c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Different geographical environment has a certain influence on the
   accumulation of fungi elements and chemical components. However, our
   knowledge is limited to elucidate the fungi elements in response to
   heterogeneous environmental and the quality differences among different
   habitats. Here, multielement analysis, FTIR spectrum, and feature-level
   fusion technique combined with chemometrics were used to study
   Wolfiporia cocos from different geographical areas, different sampling
   sites and different altitude sources. From the results, (1) there is
   significant difference in element content of samples from different
   sampling sites and no positive correlation with geographical ranges. (2)
   There is a correlation between elevation and elements, and relatively
   low elevation (<1,800 m) is conducive to the enrichment of elements. (3)
   From the perspective of elements, the W. cocos in Yuxi have relatively
   better quality. (4) FTIR and feature-level models can well realize
   origin identification. The SVM models are better than the PLS-DA models,
   and the feature-level model is better than the single FTIR models. In
   summary, this study demonstrated that the developed method was reliable
   and could realize the genuineness evaluation and origin identification
   of W. cocos. The results have implications for the establishment of the
   technology system of geographical traceability and the development of
   high-quality geographical indication products of W. cocos.},

Abstract = {Understanding the latent relationship between rural landscape and
   biodiversity conservation is of key importance when aiming to preserve
   food security, ecosystem services and the quality of the environment.
   Crop intensification negatively impacted the biodiversity of rural areas
   and was followed by the adoption of mono-cultural production models. The
   conservation of traditional agricultural landscapes (TALs) based on
   traditional land management approaches, ensures the conservation of the
   ecosystem's complexity and high levels of biodiversity. In Europe,
   Mediterranean TALs are threatened by a combination of anthropogenic and
   natural factors. The need to preserve TALs is widely recognized despite
   the lack of comprehensive information and collective policy strategies.
   On the other hand, inventories are available for endangered cultivars,
   typical products and traditional agricultural practices. This study
   focuses on the relationship between TALs and the use of local
   varieties/typical products. The analysis will: (i) define, map and
   characterize the tree-crop based traditional landscapes in one of the
   Mediterranean regions (Latium, central Italy) through a land-use change
   detection analysis (1960-2000) and (ii) identify the most endangered
   TALs based on environmental risk factors, on autochthonous
   agro-biodiversity at risk of varietal erosion and on traditional
   products that risk to disappear. Results prove that the most endangered
   rural landscapes are the ones located on fringe and marginal lands due
   to climate aridity and soil erosion. The identification of the
   endangered TALs contributes to constructing more effective strategies
   for the preservation of agro-biodiversity and natural ecosystem
   functionality.},

Abstract = {Geographical indications (GIs) mitigate information asymmetry in
   agri-food transactions by providing consumers with origin and quality
   information. This paper explores the impact of GIs on rural development
   in China by examining agricultural output and farmers' income. Utilizing
   a large county-level dataset and comprehensive official GI information,
   this study estimates the impact of GIs on agricultural output and rural
   income using panel-fixed-effects models. The results reveal that GIs
   significantly boost agricultural added value and rural per capita
   disposable income. A series of methods, including
   difference-in-differences, propensity score matching with
   difference-in-differences, and double machine learning combined with
   difference-in-differences using random forests verify the robustness of
   the results. Moreover, by categorizing GIs based on product types, the
   analysis reveals heterogeneous effects of different GI categories on
   agricultural growth and income gains for farmers. The research findings
   in this paper offer valuable insights to inform policymaking aimed at
   advancing rural development, raising farmers' incomes, and promoting

Abstract = {Due to the increasing consumer interest in wines with a controlled place
   of origin, PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) and PDO (Protected
   Designation of Origin), the most acute question is how to identify them.
   One of the most effective ways to confirm the place of origin of wine in
   global practice is a comprehensive study of the elemental profile using
   statistical analysis methods. In the period from 2020 to 2023, 152 grape
   samples of grapes were collected from various wineries in Crimea and
   Kuban. The grape must that was obtained from them was fermented in
   laboratory conditions. The elemental profile was determined in the
   prepared wines, which included 71 indicators. In the conducted work, it
   was revealed that wines from Crimea and Kuban differ statistically
   significantly in the concentration of the elements B, Ca, Cu, Mn, Na,
   Ni, Re, Si, Sn and U. At the same time, the contents of the elements U,
   Sn and Re prevail in wines from Crimea, and those of B, Ca, Cu, Mn, Na,
   Ni and Si prevail in wines from Kuban. At the same time, methods of
   univariate and multivariate statistics do not allow us to reliably
   classify wine samples from Crimea and Kuban by their place of origin. In
   order to reveal the non-linear dependence of the studied indicators in
   wines on the geographical place of grape growing, the method of a
   supervised learning Random Forest was used. After training the model on
   the dataset, the proportion of its correct predictions was 96\%. The
   model used 61 parameters, among which the most important were Ni, Re,
   Ba, Rb, Na, U, Sb, Zn, Bi, Ag and Ti.},

Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB 3},
Abstract = {This study evaluated the phenolic profiles of Malbec wines made from
   grapes of 23 parcels distributed in 12 geographical indications (GIs)
   from Mendoza, Argentina. Wines were elaborated under standardized
   winemaking conditions over three consecutive vintages (2016-2018). Data
   discriminated wines from different GIs and parcels, based on an
   integrative data analysis by chemometric tools. Vintage effect and
   specific phenolic compounds were associated with some GIs or parcels. As
   well, regional climate conditions allowed partial discrimination of the
   GIs (and also some parcels). A random forest analysis correctly
   identified 11 out of 23 individual parcels across the different
   vintages. The most notorious compounds associated with such
   classification were p-coumaric acid, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, caffeic
   acid, quercetin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside. The presented research
   allows to individualize, through phenolic profiles, parcels with unique
   characteristics over years. This is the first report characterizing
   Malbec wines coming from several GIs (and individual parcels) in
   different vintages. These results are strongly related to terroir
   features of wines, contributing to a better communication to consumers
   and to position Argentinean wines.},

Abstract = {Chrysanthemum is a common medicinal and edible Chinese herbal product,
   and its growth environment affects its quality and market sale price. So
   it has high practical value and relevance to establish an efficient,
   rapid and accurate approach to identify the origin of chrysanthemums. In
   this study, we collected chrysanthemum samples from six geographical
   indication (GI) production areas in China and analyzed the four stable
   isotope ratios (delta 13C, delta 15N, delta 18O, and delta 2H) and 44
   mineral element signatures of chrysanthemums to classify chrysanthemum.
   An analysis of variance (ANVOA) indicated that stable isotope ratios and
   mineral elements differed significantly between origins. The accuracies
   of the training set and prediction set of the random forest (RF)
   algorithm were 100\% and 98.3\%, respectively, while those of the
   partial least squares discriminant algorithm (PLS-DA) were 96.9\% and
   96.7\%, respectively; the results of the RF algorithm were slightly
   better than those of the PLS-DA. Combining stable isotopes and mineral
   elements could enhance the accuracy of origin identification. Moreover,
   the OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis)
   models for stable isotopes and mineral elements indicated that delta 2H,

   Food: A Canadian Study Using Twitter},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The consumption of local food, a major trend in industrialized countries
   around the world has experienced an unprecedented craze in the pandemic
   context that we are experiencing. Since the beginning of the crisis and
   in various media, communication about local food seems inconsistent.
   However, companies would have every interest in better communicating the
   multifaceted areas of the locality that customers value or adopting the
   same language if they wish to collaborate with each other. This research
   aims to identify and evaluate the ``fit{''} or the ``gap{''} of the
   different local food' meanings of Canadian agri-food stakeholders
   through data mining of one of their communication media: Twitter. Using
   tweets by over 1300 Twitter accounts from Canadian agri-food companies
   and a popular hashtag, we analyze a sample of their tweets in 2019 and
   2020 by creating and using a local food' keyword dictionary based on the
   concept of proximity. Term frequency and multivariate analysis of
   variance of 16,585 tweets about local food show significant differences
   in dimensions of proximity used in communications. This study shows the
   interest of using the concept of proximity to better define and
   understand the valuation of local food products. In addition, it offers
   a methodology capable of distinguishing the nuances of meaning of the
   locality of products using natural data that is accessible via social
   media.},

Title = {Class-modelling of overlapping classes. A two-step authentication
   approach},
Journal = {ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1191},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Honeybush is an indigenous herbal tea highly valued for its aroma,
   flavour and medicinal properties. It is protected as Geographical
   Indication (GI) since it is produced from a number of Cyclopia species
   that are endemic to South Africa. Most commonly used for honeybush tea
   production are C. intermedia, C. subternata and C. genistoides,
   differing slightly, but distinctly in flavour. Demand for
   species-specific honeybush tea instead of mixtures have increased,
   meriting a strategy for authentication of C. intermedia, C. subternata
   and C. genistoides. Samples of these three species were analysed, using
   hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the near-infrared spectral range. The
   data were pre-processed and used for class-modelling, a general approach
   well suited for authentication purposes. Unfortunately, since the HSI
   data of Cyclopia species studied are very similar, the classification
   results obtained with individual class-models are unsatisfactory, e.g.,
   class-models constructed for C. genistoides and C. subternata yielded
   correct classification rate (CCR) values of 76.4 and 83.1\%,
   respectively. On the other hand, discriminant modelling, which is
   another type of classification technique, led to good classification
   outcomes (CCR 98.9\%). However, the classical discriminant model cannot
   be applied for authentication purposes since it always assigns a new
   sample to one of the classes studied, even if in reality, it belongs to
   none of them. Counterfeits or non-representative samples would be
   incorrectly assigned by the discriminant model to one of the authentic
   classes. Therefore, in this study, a two-step authentication of
   overlapping classes is proposed, which combines the advantages of
   class-modelling and discriminant methods. When applied to the
   authentication of Cyclopia species studied, the two-step approach
   yielded a CCR of 97.4\%, which is a significant improvement compared to
   results obtained with the individual class-models. The proposed approach
   is general and can be applied when classes studied are very similar, and
   individual class- models lead to unsatisfactory results. (C) 2021

Title = {Authentication of honeybush and rooibos herbal teas based on their
   elemental composition},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {123},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and honeybush (Cyclopia species) are
   popular indigenous herbal teas originating from South Africa. Both are
   enjoyed for their taste and aroma and more importantly, valued for their
   medicinal properties such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic,
   anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory activity. In the European Union,
   rooibos and honeybush are protected as Geographical Indications. The
   Geographical Indication refers to products with unique characteristics
   that are related to their geographical origin. The authentication of
   products labelled as GIs is regarded as an issue of food quality and
   safety. Routine quality control procedures of GIs products prevent their
   fraud and counterfeiting on the market. However, techniques to determine
   adulteration or mislabelling of rooibos and honeybush do not exist yet.
   Therefore, in this study, the authentication of rooibos and honeybush
   based on their elemental composition was investigated. The methodology
   presented in this study combines energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence
   spectrometry (EDXRF) for elemental analysis and a one-class
   classification approach. Elemental composition of plant material highly
   depends on soil on which the plant has been grown, but also on some
   other factors such as, e.g., atmospheric pollution, or plant metabolism.
   Determination of the elemental composition of the samples by EDXRF is
   non-destructive and does not require any complex sample preparation.
   One-class classification methods are well suited for authentication and
   origin verification problems. Based on the EDXRF data of samples from
   studied teas, individual class models were constructed for rooibos and
   honeybush. Several linear and nonlinear classification techniques were
   tested in order to find the model that handles the authentication task
   the best. For honeybush tea, the best classification results were
   obtained with the use of a nonlinear method based on Potential
   Functions. For moibos tea, the highest classification outcomes were
   obtained by nonlinear One Class Partial Least Squares (OC-PLS) and the
   machine learning technique, Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD).
   The methodology implemented in the present study has the potential to be
   successfully applied for routine authentication of honeybush and rooibos
   teas.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has an important role in digital
   transformation worldwide, including in Indonesia. AI itself is a
   simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in machines and
   programmed to think like humans. At the time AI and the Internet of
   Things are connected, it can, in principle, act on data without the need
   for human intervention. AI was originally created by humans as a
   consequence of the massive digital revolution. Recently, AI has also
   developed rapidly to perform functions like humans and even produce
   works of intellectual property like humans, such as creating songs,
   making new inventions, making industrial designs, and so on. Thus, it is
   a question whether AI can be qualified as a legal subject of creator,
   inventor or designer and then register as intellectual property. This
   research answers this question from the perspective of Indonesian law
   based on Copyright Law, Patent Law, Industrial Design Law, as well as
   Trademark Law, and Geographical Indications as the existing Indonesian
   laws.},

   L.},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Lycium barbarum L. (L. barbarum) is renowned worldwide for its
   nutritional and medicinal benefits. Rapid and accurate identification of
   L. barbarum's geographic origin is essential because its nutritional
   content, medicinal efficacy, and market price significantly vary by
   region. This study proposes an innovative method combining hyperspectral
   imaging (HSI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and an improved
   ResNet-34 deep learning model to accurately identify the geographical
   origin and geographical indication (GI) markers of L. barbarum. The deep
   learning model achieved a 95.63\% accuracy, surpassed traditional
   methods by 6.26\% and reduced runtime by 29.9\% through SHapley Additive
   exPlanations (SHAP)-based feature selection. Pearson correlation
   analysis between GI markers and HSI characteristic wavelengths enhanced
   the interpretability of HSI data and further reduced runtime by 33.99\%.
   This work lays the foundation for portable multispectral devices,
   offering a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective solution for quality

Abstract = {Due to widespread product adulteration, Chinese jujube (CJ), a crop of
   global economic importance with nutritional and medicinal properties,
   struggles with geographical traceability. The study introduced a
   Metabolomics-Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)-Machine Learning
   (ML) framework to set up an origin identification system for CJ from six
   production regions in China (Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong,
   and Hebei). Using LC-MS/MS for untargeted metabolomics, researchers
   identified 312 metabolites. Multivariate analysis revealed 37 key
   discriminant variables (VIP > 1). KPCA compressed these features into 28
   principal components (retaining 90.59 \% information). Compared with the
   traditional method, the K-means clustering after dimensionality
   reduction of KPCA greatly improves the sample differentiation ability:
   the origin samples with original data overlap with fuzzy boundaries;
   while after dimensionality reduction, the six origin samples form a
   clear and compact cluster, which achieves accurate classification. This
   study pioneers a ``Metabolomics-KPCA-ML{''} paradigm, offering a
   solution for traceability of geographical indication agricultural

Title = {Machine learning based on metabolomics to discriminate Wuyi rock tea
   production areas and ``rock flavor{''} substances},
Journal = {FOOD CHEMISTRY-X},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The ``rock flavor{''} quality of Wuyi Rock Tea varies across production
   areas, but scientific classification criteria for production areas and a
   comprehensive understanding of the chemical basis of ``rock flavor{''}
   remain limited. This study integrated metabolomics and machine learning
   to systematicallyanalyze the volatile metabolite profiles of 137 Wuyi
   Rock Teasamples (Zhengyan, Banyan, and Waishan productions) and
   established a high-precision random forest model (99 \% accuracy) for
   production area discrimination. Feature importance analysis identified
   Zhengyan production markers as hotrienol, dihydroactinidiolide, benzyl
   alcohol, and trans-nerolidol.Banyan production markers as hotrienol,
   benzyl alcohol, trans-nerolidol, and heptanal,and Waishan production
   markers as methyl decanoate, (Z)-hept-4-enal, and 2,4-heptadienal. This
   study innovatively developed a volatile metabolite fingerprint-based
   system for Wuyi Rock Tea production area authentication and elucidated
   the key chemical foundations of ``rock flavor,{''} providing theoretical
   support for geographical indication protection and processing
   optimization.},

Title = {Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Combined With Random Forest Algorithm : A
   Fast and Effective Strategy for Origin Traceability of Fuzi},

Abstract = {Effective and reliable methods of origin certification are essential for
   protecting high-value Chinese medicinal materials (e.g geo-authentic
   Chinese medicinal materials, geographical indication products, etc.)
   from designated regions. As a famous traditional Chinese medicine and a
   geo-authentic Chinese medicinal material produced in Sichuan Province,
   Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi) has a remarkable curative
   effect and wide clinical application is in great demand in domestic and
   international markets. The efficacy and price of the Fuzi of different
   origins vary, and it is difficult for the public to identify them
   through traditional experience accurately. Mass spectrometry-based on
   plant metabolomics is a tedious and lengthy test sample preparation
   process, complicated operation, long detection time, and low
   reproducibility. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a mature, fast and
   nondestructive detection technique was integrated with machine learning
   to bring new ways for online quality supervision and control of Chinese
   medicinal materials. Therefore, a non-destructive identification model
   based on NIR spectroscopy combined with a random forest (RF) algorithm
   was developed for different origins of Fuzi. A total of 255 samples of
   Fuzi were collected from the major cultivation regions of Sichuan,
   Shaanxi and Yunnan, and the diffuse reflectance spectral information of
   all samples was obtained using Fourier transform NIR spectroscopy.
   Single and combined spectral preprocessing methods are used to eliminate
   multiple interferences in the spectra, and the best preprocessing method
   is screened and used as an input indicator to build an RF model. The
   comprehensive performance of the RF model was evaluated using
   sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy. The results showed that
   Savitzky-Golay 11-point smoothing combined with multivariate scattering
   correction was the best preprocessing method. Using only the full
   wavelength data, the prediction accuracy of the RF model for the three
   groups of provincial samples was also checked over 90\%, and the
   prediction accuracy after preprocessing reached 98.39\%. For the
   city/county level samples, the RF model also had the excellent
   discriminative ability, greater than 75\% accuracy. The RF model
   achieved 100\% recognition rate for samples from cultivation areas
   around the traditional production areas. The top 100 feature wave
   numbers were filtered out, and the model was re-optimized, and the
   recognition accuracy of the model for each city/county level region was
   over 85\%, especially for some samples from the highlands was
   significantly improved. In this study, an environment-friendly
   traceability strategy with faster analysis, less sample loss and higher
   precision was adopted, providing a new model for the rapid and efficient
   identification of Fuzi of different origins and a reference for the
   subsequent identification and traceability of Fuzi and its related
   processed products.},

Title = {Multivariate discrimination of Chinese vinegars using multi-element:
   Implications for origin traceability and dietary safety},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {145},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The authenticity of geographical indications of famous vinegars is
   crucial for maintaining market order and consumer confidence. In this
   study, 60 vinegar samples were collected from four renowned Chinese
   vinegar, including Shanxi aged vinegar, Baoning vinegar, Zhenjiang
   fragrant vinegar, and Fujian Monascus vinegar, and were analyzed for 18
   multi-mineral elements. Significant variations in elemental composition
   were observed, with Fujian Monascus vinegar exhibiting the lowest
   elemental content. Fermentation methods (liquid-state vs. solid-state)
   significantly influenced mineral composition, with liquid-state
   fermentation resulting in lower mineral levels. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) revealed strong positive correlations among specific
   elements (e.g., B, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Se, Cd, Ba, Mo, Co, and Ni),
   suggesting their primary origin from raw grain ingredients. Both linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares-discriminant
   analysis (PLS-DA) identified key classification markers, including Cd,
   B, Na, Pb, V, As, and Mo. LDA demonstrated superior machine learning
   performance, achieving classification accuracies of 96.7 \% for the
   training set and 90 \% for the validation set. A health risk assessment
   confirmed that daily vinegar consumption does not pose a heavy
   metalrelated health risk. This study establishes an effective
   methodology for vinegar authentication and confirms its safety,
   providing valuable insights for quality control and traceability.},

Title = {Enhanced understanding of dark tea quality through integrated GC-IMS and
   E-Nose analysis},
Journal = {LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {224},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Gas Chromatography Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) and electronic
   nose (E-Nose) were utilized to investigate the aroma components of
   Liupao tea and other dark teas, employing Principal component analysis
   (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis
   (OPLS-DA) for the statistical analysis of the detection data. A total of
   58 aroma component forms were isolated using GC-IMS, with 39 of these
   components being clearly identified. Notably, Liupao tea exhibits
   distinct volatile characteristics, as evidenced by significantly higher
   concentrations of ethyl butanoate, pentyl butanoate, and methional
   compared to other dark teas (p < 0.01). The GC-IMS analyzes the
   foundational framework of nine common markers in dark tea, including
   acetone, 2-propanol, and acetic acid, specifically in Liupao tea, while
   the E-Nose captures the spatial distribution nuances of Liupao tea's
   overall aroma. This bimodal analytical approach effectively integrates
   the material basis with sensory representation, presenting a novel
   methodological paradigm for evaluating dark tea quality. The research
   findings not only establish a volatile characteristic map for Liupao tea
   but also utilize machine learning algorithms to identify key
   discriminant indicators. This provides a scientific basis for dark tea
   category identification, process optimization, and the protection of
   geographical indications.},

Title = {Rapid authentication of Chinese oolong teas using atmospheric solids
   analysis probe-mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) combined with supervised
   pattern recognition models},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {134},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) is an emerging technique in food
   authenticity and traceability study due to the minimal sample
   preparation required and short analysis time. Herein, a non-targeted
   fingerprinting approach using an AMS technique, atmospheric solids
   analysis probe - mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS), was used to authenticate
   Chinese oolong teas. In the first part of the study, a total of 38
   authentic samples from three main varieties - Guangdong Dancong, Taiwan
   Dongding, and Anxi Tieguanyin - were analysed and four discriminant
   analysis models were built using the fingerprint data from ASAP-MS. The
   principal component analysis-k nearest neighbour (PCA-kNN) model yielded
   the best classification outcome, where the classification accuracies of
   the training and validation sets were 100\% and 92.6\%, respectively.
   The second part of the study involved detecting possible adulteration of
   Anxi Tieguanyin, which is a high-value oolong tea under the register of
   protected geographical indication (PGI) of the European Union (EU).
   Adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin was simulated by blending the authentic
   samples with 20-80\% w/w of low-quality oolong teas. One-class modelling
   using datadriven soft independent modelling of class analogies
   (DD-SIMCA), with the Anxi Tieguanyin as the target class, was built
   using the fingerprint data of the authentic and adulterated samples. An
   excellent sensitivity of 100\% and a high specificity of 98.1\% were
   achieved, indicating that it is possible to detect substitution
   adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin using ASAP-MS combined with one-class
   modelling. Overall, findings from this study exemplify the potential of
   ASAP-MS to be used for rapid, inexpensive, and high throughput
   classification of Chinese oolong tea varieties and screening for
   substitution adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin oolong tea.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, wine quality and certification have been assessed through
   sensory analysis by trained tasters. However, this method has the
   limitation of relying on highly specialized individuals who are
   typically trained to evaluate only specific types of products, such as
   those associated with a particular Denomination of Origin (D. O.), etc.
   While tasters can often identify instances of fraud, they are generally
   unable to pinpoint its origins or explain the mechanisms behind it. On
   the other hand, classical biochemistry has made significant progress in
   understanding various aspects of winemaking. However, it has yet to
   identify the specific metabolites responsible for the unique
   characteristics of wines, particularly those influenced by complex
   variables involving multiple compounds, such as geographical differences
   between regions or vineyards. The concept of the ``Terroir
   fingerprint{''} has emerged as a novel approach to wine certification.
   The concept refers to the unique characteristics imparted to a wine by
   its geography, climate, and aging process. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
   (NMR) technology plays a pivotal role in establishing this ``Terroir
   fingerprint{''} because it enables precise identification,
   quantification, and differentiation of the compounds present in wine.
   NMR provides a highly reproducible and specific method for
   certification. This work introduces an innovative project that combines
   NMR technology with Artificial Intelligence to create a profiling model
   for certifying the authenticity and quality of `Jerez-Xe<acute
   accent>re`s-Sherry' wines.},

Abstract = {Introduction Knowledge management is essential to ensure the
   sustainability of rural communities and small producers since it
   generates value for innovation, productivity, and competitiveness. The
   aim of this study is to identify relevant factors for adequate
   decision-making in managing knowledge in the Mexican mezcal industry and
   its impact on developing rural communities and small producers -
   mezcaleros. For this purpose, a decision-making model for managing
   scientific and ancestral knowledge is created to support links with
   universities, research centers, and rural communities to accelerate
   innovation and competitiveness in this sector.Methods The analysis
   methods were carried out through decision-making, machine-learning
   techniques, and fuzzy logic.Results The Bayesian Network model suggests
   that the preceding variables to optimize the Mezcaleros Knowledge
   Management are the Mezcaleros Indigenous community, the Denomination of
   Origin, Scientific and Ancestral Knowledge, Waste Management and Use,
   and Jima.Discussion This knowledge management model aims to guide small
   producers to be more productive and competitive through the support of a
   facilitator.},

Abstract = {Worldwide sustainable development is threatened by current agricultural
   land change trends, particularly by the increasing rural farmland
   abandonment and agricultural intensification phenomena. In Mediterranean
   countries, these processes are affecting especially traditional olive
   groves with enormous socio-economic costs to rural areas, endangering
   environmental sustainability and biodiversity. Traditional olive groves
   abandonment and intensification are clearly related to the reduction of
   olive oil production income, leading to reduced economic viability. Most
   promising strategies to boost traditional groves competitiveness-such as
   olive oil differentiation through adoption of protected denomination of
   origin labels and development of value-added olive products-rely on
   knowledge of the olive varieties and its specific properties that confer
   their uniqueness and authenticity. Given the lack of information about
   olive varieties on traditional groves, a feasible and inexpensive method
   of variety identification is required. We analyzed leaf spectral
   information of ten Portuguese olive varieties with a powerful
   data-mining approach in order to verify the ability of satellite's
   hyperspectral sensors to provide an accurate olive variety
   identification. Our results show that these olive varieties are
   distinguishable by leaf reflectance information and suggest that even
   satellite open-source data could be used to map them. Additional
   advantages of olive varieties mapping were further discussed.},
