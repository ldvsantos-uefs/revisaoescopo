AB  - Background: Fruit spirits (FS) are distilled beverages produced in all parts of the world for local consumption, basically, of significant cultural value for regions or ethnic groups. The studies about FS are important because they preserve the traditions of local cultures and guarantee the quality of these products. Factors such as fruit variety, pH, fermentation and distillation practices, and storage conditions profoundly shape their chemical complexity. The growing appreciation for products with geographical identity and the absence of official data on artisanal production, however, has raised concerns regarding fraud, which may involve adulteration with industrial ethanol and the misrepresentation of origin, affecting both the regional culture, including economic effects, and public health. The uses of chemometric models, treatment of multivariate data, obtained by instrumental analytical techniques has emerged as the most promising approach to enhance traceability, protect geographical indications, and maintain consistent quality standards. Scope and approach: This review examines the current state of chemometric strategies in instrumental analysis data used to authenticate, classify, and identify FS. This paper examines the application of classical statistical methods (PCA, LDA, PLS-DA) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including SVM and ANN, to identify complex patterns and develop robust predictive models. The analytical techniques used to obtain the data were produced by high-resolution chromatographic techniques (GC-MS), Infrared with Mass Spectrometry (IRMS), Inductively Coupled Plasma com Mass Spectrometry (ICP/MS), and Raman Spectroscopy. Key findings and conclusions: The results demonstrate that the application of chemometric models in instrumental analytical data are important for deciphering the chemical complexity of the FS matrix. Techniques like GC-MS provide high resolution for volatiles, the integration of multi-signal data such as IRMS, ICP/MS, and vibrational spectroscopies offer greater predictive power for traceability. ML algorithms enhance quality control and authentication, providing accuracy and reliability in systems marked by high variability. The future direction points toward the consolidation of omics studies and the development of real-time predictive models that protect the terroir and authenticity of fruit spirits. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Jinhua ham, a geographical indication agriculture product in China, possesses exquisite flavor during fermentation. Three-year Jinhua ham is highly valued for superior flavor and nutrition, but current age-discrimination relies on the experience of workers, leaving high adulteration risks. In this study, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) were adopted to analyze the differences of flavor compounds in Jinhua ham aged for 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 years. Fifty-four aroma-active compounds were identified through OAV ≥ 1 from Jinhua ham with different ages, with the flavor changing from mushroom to citrus/grassy/buttery, then nutty, and finally to dominant coconut, peach, and floral-fatty notes. And 18 key discriminative compounds were screened out through plotted compounds content distribution. Further, 1-octen-3-ol and decanoic acid were found applicable for discriminating the age of ham based on the scatter plot and SHAP value. Then, four age-discriminating machine-learning models (LR, SVM, NB, and DT) were constructed and exhibited high accuracy, with the highest reaching 100 %. Especially, a portable ham quality evaluation circuit was constructed based on the DT classification models due to its good generalization ability and concise structure. This study provides a theoretical basis for accurately predicting ages of Jinhua ham by GC–MS with machine learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to geographical indication advantage of Hongmeiren (HMR) citrus, economically motivated origin fraud has emerged, alongside significant differences in antioxidant components. This study employed benchtop visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning models for simultaneously identifying geographical origins and quantifying antioxidant components in HMR citrus. Savitzky-Golay and area normalization pre-processing exhibited the performance improvement in classification and regression models, respectively. Subsequently, Boruta algorithm feature selection further improved the both regression and classification performance of models. Among these, feedforward neural network model achieved the highest classification accuracy (88.7 %) for geographical origin, with few misclassified samples (1–2) in each origin and an excellent AUC (0.943). It also exhibited highest regression effects in quantifying ascorbic acid (R2 = 0.875), total phenolics (R2 = 0.856), and total flavonoids (R2 = 0.806). Thus, benchtop Vis-NIR spectroscopy offers a practical and efficient multitask analysis method for simultaneous quality assessment and geographical authenticity identification in fruits. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The “rock flavor” quality of Wuyi Rock Tea varies across production areas, but scientific classification criteria for production areas and a comprehensive understanding of the chemical basis of “rock flavor” remain limited. This study integrated metabolomics and machine learning to systematicallyanalyze the volatile metabolite profiles of 137 Wuyi Rock Teasamples (Zhengyan, Banyan, and Waishan productions) and established a high-precision random forest model (99 % accuracy) for production area discrimination. Feature importance analysis identified Zhengyan production markers as hotrienol, dihydroactinidiolide, benzyl alcohol, and trans-nerolidol.Banyan production markers as hotrienol, benzyl alcohol, trans-nerolidol, and heptanal,and Waishan production markers as methyl decanoate, (Z)-hept-4-enal, and 2,4-heptadienal. This study innovatively developed a volatile metabolite fingerprint-based system for Wuyi Rock Tea production area authentication and elucidated the key chemical foundations of “rock flavor,” providing theoretical support for geographical indication protection and processing optimization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to widespread product adulteration, Chinese jujube (CJ), a crop of global economic importance with nutritional and medicinal properties, struggles with geographical traceability. The study introduced a Metabolomics-Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)-Machine Learning (ML) framework to set up an origin identification system for CJ from six production regions in China (Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei). Using LC-MS/MS for untargeted metabolomics, researchers identified 312 metabolites. Multivariate analysis revealed 37 key discriminant variables (VIP > 1). KPCA compressed these features into 28 principal components (retaining 90.59 % information). Compared with the traditional method, the K-means clustering after dimensionality reduction of KPCA greatly improves the sample differentiation ability: the origin samples with original data overlap with fuzzy boundaries; while after dimensionality reduction, the six origin samples form a clear and compact cluster, which achieves accurate classification. This study pioneers a “Metabolomics-KPCA-ML” paradigm, offering a solution for traceability of geographical indication agricultural products. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally, wine quality and certification have been assessed through sensory analysis by trained tasters. However, this method has the limitation of relying on highly specialized individuals who are typically trained to evaluate only specific types of products, such as those associated with a particular Denomination of Origin (D.O.), etc. While tasters can often identify instances of fraud, they are generally unable to pinpoint its origins or explain the mechanisms behind it. On the other hand, classical biochemistry has made significant progress in understanding various aspects of winemaking. However, it has yet to identify the specific metabolites responsible for the unique characteristics of wines, particularly those influenced by complex variables involving multiple compounds, such as geographical differences between regions or vineyards. The concept of the “Terroir fingerprint” has emerged as a novel approach to wine certification. The concept refers to the unique characteristics imparted to a wine by its geography, climate, and aging process. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology plays a pivotal role in establishing this “Terroir fingerprint” because it enables precise identification, quantification, and differentiation of the compounds present in wine. NMR provides a highly reproducible and specific method for certification. This work introduces an innovative project that combines NMR technology with Artificial Intelligence to create a profiling model for certifying the authenticity and quality of ‘Jerez-Xérès-Sherry’ wines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The authenticity of geographical indications of famous vinegars is crucial for maintaining market order and consumer confidence. In this study, 60 vinegar samples were collected from four renowned Chinese vinegar, including Shanxi aged vinegar, Baoning vinegar, Zhenjiang fragrant vinegar, and Fujian Monascus vinegar, and were analyzed for 18 multi-mineral elements. Significant variations in elemental composition were observed, with Fujian Monascus vinegar exhibiting the lowest elemental content. Fermentation methods (liquid-state vs. solid-state) significantly influenced mineral composition, with liquid-state fermentation resulting in lower mineral levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong positive correlations among specific elements (e.g., B, K, Ca, Mg, Al, Mn, Se, Cd, Ba, Mo, Co, and Ni), suggesting their primary origin from raw grain ingredients. Both linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) identified key classification markers, including Cd, B, Na, Pb, V, As, and Mo. LDA demonstrated superior machine learning performance, achieving classification accuracies of 96.7 % for the training set and 90 % for the validation set. A health risk assessment confirmed that daily vinegar consumption does not pose a heavy metal-related health risk. This study establishes an effective methodology for vinegar authentication and confirms its safety, providing valuable insights for quality control and traceability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A simple and economic high-performance liquid chromatography with UV–vis detection (HPLC–UV) metabolomic fingerprinting methodology was developed and applied after a water extraction procedure to obtain sample chemical descriptors suitable for meat authentication by chemometrics. Three hundred meat samples involving different species (lamb, beef, pork, rabbit, quail, chicken, turkey, and duck) as well as different non-genetic attributes (protected geographical indications, organic production, and Halal and Kosher meats) were analyzed, and the obtained HPLC–UV fingerprints subjected to PCA and PLS-DA for classification and authentication. Excellent PLS-DA discrimination and classification performance was accomplished for calibration and cross-validation, with sensitivity and specificity values higher than 100% and 99.3%, respectively, and classification errors below 0.4%, when meat species were considered. The prediction capability when employing a classification decision tree consisting on consecutive dual PLS-DA models built using a hierarchical model builder was of 100% accuracy when 48 meat samples were subjected to the model as unknown samples. Multiclass PLS-DA classification performances when addressing meat geographical origin, organic productions and Halal and Kosher products were also very acceptable, with overall sensitivity and specificity values higher than 91.2%, and classification errors below 6.9%. Finally, fraudulent meat adulteration cases involving PGI, organic and Halal and Kosher adulterated meats were evaluated by partial least squares (PLS) regression, allowing the detection and quantitation of adulteration levels within the range from 15 to 85% with prediction errors below 6.6%, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed methodology to assess meat authenticity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on the Howard-Sheth model and brand equity theory, this study takes Benjarong rice as a case study, and applies big data technologies such as LDA theme model and co-occurrence analysis to analyse the dynamic mechanism of imported agricultural product brands influencing consumption decisions. The study found that: (1) consumers' brand sentiment has a significant positive skewed distribution (71.7% positive evaluation), and the synergistic driving effect of origin marking and cultural symbols is prominent; (2) consumer decision-making focuses on the three dimensions of brand effect, quality assurance and service experience, and the co-occurrence intensity of “brand-quality” reaches 0.68, which verifies the two-way reinforcement path of “information processing-quality perception” in the Howard-Sheth model; (3) the service experience is enhanced by the brand equity theory through the LDA theme model and big data analysis, and analyzes the dynamic mechanism of imported agricultural products brand influence. (3) Service experience reflects the risk buffer function through the 12.8% increase in customer churn rate. Accordingly, a three-dimensional competition model is constructed: geographical indication certification and cultural narrative synergistically strengthen the brand premium, blockchain traceability breaks the quality and trust dilemma, and cold chain logistics and environmentally friendly packaging design constructs a trust safety valve. The research results provide big data decision-making support for breaking through the monopoly of imported brands and realising the transformation of “blue ocean value”. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 1H NMR fingerprinting of virgin olive oils (VOOs) and a collection of binary classification models arranged in a decision tree are presented as a stepwise strategy to determine the geographical origin of a VOO at four levels, i.e. provenance from an EU member state or outside the EU, country and region of origin, and compliance with a geographical indication scheme. This approach supports current EU regulation that makes labelling of the geographical origin mandatory for olive oil. Currently, official methods for its control are still lacking. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and random forest for classification afforded robust and stable binary classification models to verify the geographical origin of VOOs; however, the former outperformed the latter in terms of accuracy and robustness. The prediction abilities of the best binary PLS-DA model for each case study were between 80% and 100% for both classes in cross-validation and in external validation. The satisfactory results achieved for the verification of the geographical origin of VOOs, together with those of our previous studies on the discrimination of olive oil categories, the detection of olive oils blended with vegetable oils (Alonso-Salces et al., 2022), and the determination of the stability, freshness, storage time and conditions, and olive oil best−before date (Alonso-Salces et al., 2021), confirm that a single 1H NMR analysis of an olive oil sample can provide useful information to control several EU regulations related to olive oil marketing standards (Regulation (EU) 2022/2104 and Regulation (EU) 2024/1143). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The origin traceability of lamb is a longstanding concern for consumers. Despite the widespread application of untargeted metabolomics in meat origin traceability, challenges remain in achieving rapid and accurate identification of biomarkers. This study utilized untargeted metabolomics to analyse five breeds of geographical indication lamb, obtaining profile data comprising a total of 4139 metabolites. Using random forest recursive feature elimination, 29 potential biomarkers were initially identified, which showed significant breed-specific and production environment-related variations. Upon further assessment, a refined panel of 14 metabolic biomarkers demonstrated optimal accuracy and robustness in tracing lamb origin. When combined with the Naive Bayes algorithm, these biomarkers yielded the highest classification accuracy among all evaluated machine learning methods. The random forest recursive feature elimination presents a practical approach for handling high-dimensional metabolomics datasets compared to previous analytical methods. These findings also provide valuable insights into the development of machine learning-based biomarker panels, greatly enhancing the breed-specific traceability of lamb. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Gas Chromatography Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) and electronic nose (E-Nose) were utilized to investigate the aroma components of Liupao tea and other dark teas, employing Principal component analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) for the statistical analysis of the detection data. A total of 58 aroma component forms were isolated using GC-IMS, with 39 of these components being clearly identified. Notably, Liupao tea exhibits distinct volatile characteristics, as evidenced by significantly higher concentrations of ethyl butanoate, pentyl butanoate, and methional compared to other dark teas (p < 0.01). The GC-IMS analyzes the foundational framework of nine common markers in dark tea, including acetone, 2-propanol, and acetic acid, specifically in Liupao tea, while the E-Nose captures the spatial distribution nuances of Liupao tea's overall aroma. This bimodal analytical approach effectively integrates the material basis with sensory representation, presenting a novel methodological paradigm for evaluating dark tea quality. The research findings not only establish a volatile characteristic map for Liupao tea but also utilize machine learning algorithms to identify key discriminant indicators. This provides a scientific basis for dark tea category identification, process optimization, and the protection of geographical indications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the sales of Geographical Indication agricultural products (GI agri-products) have increased annually, yet various aspects of their perceived value remain inadequately defined. This study reconstructs the perceived value model for GI agri-products based on their unique regional attributes, while also integrating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Aims to delve into these factors to clarify how GI products attract consumers and influence their purchase decisions. A mixed-method approach was employed, combining PLS-SEM and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze data collected from 358 consumers in the Chinese market. Notably, ANN complements SEM by addressing its limitations in capturing nonlinear relationships. Results indicate that perceived value is the primary driver of purchase intentions, followed by attitude and perceived behavioral control, with subjective norms having a lesser yet still significant impact. These insights provide valuable implications for marketing strategies, assisting stakeholders in effectively promoting GI agri-products. By enhancing consumers' experiences of the non-functional value of GI agri-products, marketing efforts for these products can be more effectively realized. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Life is fundamentally unequal, shaped by the arbitrary circumstances of birth and fate. The chapter critically explores the role of intellectual property (IP) law within the framework of meritocracy, arguing that meritocratic IP can provide effective incentives to fostering creativity, commerce, and innovation, to move up one’s position in society and change the culture in the process. However, meritocratic IP should not be used to justify or perpetuate inequality. IP rights, copyright, patents, trademarks, geographical indications (GIs), cultural heritage rights (CHR), and trade secrets, are analyzed for their meritocratic value and their potential to either exacerbate or mitigate inequality. The digital transformation and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) present new challenges, where creative destruction may widen income inequality while also lowering resource inequality by increasing access to goods and services. Additionally, the spatial and cultural dimensions of IP, particularly in the context of GIs and CHRs, are examined for how they can entrench existing disparities. The chapter advocates for a recalibration of IP law that better aligns with true meritocratic principles while ensuring that it does not reinforce inequality. It calls for a more flexible and inclusive IP system that respects both the heritage of the past and the innovation of the future, ultimately aiming to create a society where meritocracy drives inclusive progress and shared prosperity rather than entrenched inequities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Fraud is rampant in the tea market globally, and a real-time online tea identification method is needed to improve transparency in the tea production industry. In order to detect the origin of Pu 'er ripe tea, two-dimensional gray image data of tea were extracted based on Hyperspectral imaging technology, and AlexNet model was established. The results show that the modeling effect is best when the data are subjected to multivariate scattering correction+Savitzky Golay (MSC+SG) preprocessing and the size of the first layer of convolutional kernel is set to 9 × 9, and the accuracy of recognizing the origin of Pu'er ripe tea reaches 95.66 %. The classification accuracy is 6.25 % and 8.22 % higher than that of support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLSR-DA), which are traditional machine learning models based on spectral data, respectively. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of the model, the extracted features were visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE); and external validation and visualization based on the AlexNet model was performed on 1200 samples with an accuracy of over 96.50 %. Overall, HSI combined with AlexNet model can be a fast and accurate detection method to recognize the origin of Pu'er ripe tea. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Panax notoginseng (P. notoginseng) is a traditional medicinal plant with high medicinal and economic values. The authenticity of P. notoginseng often determines its quality, and the quality of geographical indication (GI)-producing areas is usually superior to that of other producing areas, which are exploited by unscrupulous traders and affect the market order. The aim of this study was to characterize and identify the geographic origin of P. notoginseng using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy, with rapid detection combined with multivariate analysis. The use of principal component analysis and correlation spectral analysis enabled the initial differential characterization and identification of P. notoginseng from different production areas. Then, random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models were established, and the results show that the results showed that the second-order derivative preprocessing and successive projection algorithm feature extraction achieved 100% classification correctness and the model training time is the shortest. Further constructing the image recognition model, synchronous two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) image combined with residual convolutional neural network achieved accurate classification (accuracy of 100%) and did not require complex preprocessing and artificial feature extraction process, to maximize the avoidance of errors caused by human factors. The recognition results of the externally validated set showed that the image recognition method has a strong generalization ability and has a high potential for application in the identification of P. notoginseng production areas. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traceability and mislabelling of black tea for their geographical origin is known as a major fraud concern of the sector. Discrimination among various geographical indications (GIs) can be challenging due to the complexity of chemical fingerprints in multi-class metabolomics analysis. In this study, 302 black tea samples from 9 main cultivation GI regions were collected. A comprehensive non-targeted fingerprinting workflow was built on liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF), and a comparison between conventional chemometrics modelling and machine learning was performed. 229 and 145 metabolites were selected as biomarkers and the model robustness/performance were further validated through internal 7-fold cross-validation and external validation, showing 100 % accuracy for discriminating GI origin on both. This research provided a novel solution to enhance transparency and traceability in the black tea supply chain for lab scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed biomarker selection workflow revealed more insights for future machine learning-derived non-targeted metabolomics research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Senise red pepper, known as peperone crusco, is a protected geographical indication (PGI) product from Basilicata, Italy, traditionally consumed dried. Producers use semi-open greenhouses to meet PGI standards, but significant losses are caused by rot from microorganisms thriving in high moisture, temperature, and humidity, which also encourage pest infestations. To minimize losses, a low-cost alert system was developed. The study, conducted in summer 2022 and 2023, used external parameters from the ALSIA Senise weather station and internal sensors monitoring the air temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse. Since rot is complex and difficult to model, an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach was adopted. A feed forward neural network (FFNN) estimated greenhouse climate conditions as if it were empty, comparing them with actual values when peppers were present. This revealed the most critical period was the first 3–4 days after introduction and identified a critical air relative humidity threshold. The system could also predict microclimatic parameters inside the greenhouse with red peppers, issuing warnings one hour before risk conditions arose. In 2023, it was tested by comparing predicted values with previously identified thresholds. When critical levels were exceeded, greenhouse operators were alerted to adjust conditions. In 2023, pepper rot decreased. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The characteristics of lotus seeds (LS) are influenced by variety and environment. However, it remains unknown the difference of metabolites and elements of LS from different origins. In this study, an accurate quantification method (97–107 %) for 20 mineral elements in LS was developed, and a metabolomic method was established to identify a total of 323 metabolites in LS. Mineral composition analysis revealed significant variations in the mineral element contents among LS samples from seven geographical regions. LS were rich in potassium (14,710 mg/kg), manganese (67.19 mg/kg), with a low level of sodium (210 mg/kg). A total of 10 mineral elements and 117 metabolites (p < 0.05 and VIP > 1) were identified as the potential geographical markers of LS by integration analysis. The linear discriminant analysis model showed high prediction accuracy. This study provides strong experimental evidence to maintain the authenticity and quality of LS in the food industry. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The multi-elemental profile has repeatedly been proposed as a reliable indicator of the geographical origin of plant-derived foods, as mineral composition accurately reflects the local soil geochemistry and environmental factors. However, this approach may fail in distinguishing specimens from nearby locations, which are expected to be exposed to similar geoclimatic conditions. Herein, we studied 70 chickpea samples collected in four southwestern Spanish provinces, two located within the Protected Geographical Indication ‘Garbanzo de Escacena’ (i.e., Huelva and Sevilla), as well as other two boundary areas (i.e., Cádiz and Córdoba). Then, inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry was employed to simultaneously determine 31 trace elements and 16 rare-earth elements. Interestingly, we found great similarities in the mineral content of chickpeas cultivated in the regions ascribed to the Protected Geographical Indication, but these could be clearly discriminated from the rest of the samples. Afterward, the application of state-of-the-art machine learning tools provided predictive models with good performance in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the combination of multi-elemental analysis and advanced chemometrics could be a powerful strategy for food authentication and traceability according to the geographical origin. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Northeast India has a rich cultural heritage, shown through its variety of traditional clothing, each with unique meanings and history. This study aims to make it easier to identify and recognize these traditional outfits using advanced computer techniques, specifically deep learning combined with Geographic Indication (GI) tags. GI tags help connect each attire to its specific cultural and regional background. We used ResNet50 model to build a system that can automatically recognize and categorize traditional clothing from Northeast India. By adding GI tags, our system can more accurately identify these outfits based on their cultural origins. MobileNetV3 and EfficientNetB0 models were used to compare with the ResNet50 accuracy. We have tested this system with collection of ethnic dress images and found that it effectively distinguishes between different dress types with high accuracy. Using deep learning with GI tags not only improves the accuracy of identifying traditional outfits but also helps preserve and promote the cultural heritage of Northeast India. This work highlights how advanced technology can support the documentation and appreciation of unique cultural traditions, providing a useful tool for cultural preservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study successfully combined widely targeted lipidomic with a back propagation (BP) neural network optimized based on a particle swarm algorithm to identify the authenticity of Yanchi Tan lamb. An electronic nose and gas chromatography–olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS) were used to explore the flavor differences in Tan lamb from various regions. Among the 17 identified volatile compounds, 16 showed significant regional differences (p < 0.05). Lipidomic identified 1080 molecules across 41 lipid classes, with 11 lipids, including Carnitine 15:0, Carnitine 17:1, and Carnitine C8:1-OH, serving as potential markers for Yanchi Tan lamb. In addition, a stepwise linear discriminant model and three types of BP neural networks were used to identify the origin of Tan lamb. The results showed that particle swarm optimization-back propagation (PSO-BP) neural network had the best prediction effect, with 100 % prediction accuracy in both the training and test sets. The established PSO-BP model was able to achieve effective discrimination between Yanchi and non-Yanchi Tan lamb. These results provide a comprehensive perspective on the discrimination of Yanchi Tan lambs and improve the understanding of Tan lamb flavor and lipid composition in relation to origin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Lycium barbarum L. (L. barbarum) is renowned worldwide for its nutritional and medicinal benefits. Rapid and accurate identification of L. barbarum's geographic origin is essential because its nutritional content, medicinal efficacy, and market price significantly vary by region. This study proposes an innovative method combining hyperspectral imaging (HSI), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and an improved ResNet-34 deep learning model to accurately identify the geographical origin and geographical indication (GI) markers of L. barbarum. The deep learning model achieved a 95.63% accuracy, surpassed traditional methods by 6.26% and reduced runtime by 29.9% through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based feature selection. Pearson correlation analysis between GI markers and HSI characteristic wavelengths enhanced the interpretability of HSI data and further reduced runtime by 33.99%. This work lays the foundation for portable multispectral devices, offering a rapid, accurate, and cost-effective solution for quality assurance and market regulation of L. barbarum products. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Most existing studies have focused on identifying the origin of species with protected geographical indications while neglecting to determine the proximate geographical origin of different species. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy to identify the origin of 156 Polygonatum kingianum samples from six regions in Yunnan, China. In this work, spectral images of different modes reveal more information about the P. kingianum. Comparing the performance of traditional machine learning models according to single spectrum and data fusion, the middle-level data fusion-principal component model has the best performance, and its sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are all 1, and the model has the least number of variables. The residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) model constructed in the 1050–850 cm−1 band confirms that fewer variables are beneficial in improving the accuracy of the model. In conclusion, this study verifies the feasibility of the proposed strategy and establishes a practical model to determine the source of P. kingianum. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Authentication of geographical indication (GI) is important for the protection of GI rice due to its unique quality characteristics and high economic value in the market. This paper compared the appearance quality, cooking quality and nutritional quality of four types of GI rice products (Luoding rice, Zhefang Tribute rice, Xijiang rice and Wanbaozhen rice) in China. Luoding rice was found to have the highest nutritional value with respect to protein and amino acid profile. The vitamin content of Xijiang rice was significantly higher than that of other types of GI rice. Principal component analysis showed that Luoding rice had a quite different protein, aspect ratio and amino acid profile from other GI rice samples. Zhefang Tribute rice had quite different cooking quality, fatty acid and sugar profile from Xijiang rice and Wanbaozhen rice. Geographical origin was predicted by using a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model with quality characteristics as the input variables. It was found that all the samples were accurately predicted in both training and test sets, indicating the potential of using quality characteristics to discriminate GI rice samples from different geographical origins. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Greek giant beans, also known as “Gigantes Elefantes” (elephant beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L.,) are a traditional and highly cherished culinary delight in Greek cuisine, contributing significantly to the economic prosperity of local producers. However, the issue of food fraud associated with these products poses substantial risks to both consumer safety and economic stability. In the present study, multi-elemental analysis combined with decision tree learning algorithms were investigated for their potential to determine the multi-elemental profile and discriminate the origin of beans collected from the two geographical areas. Ensuring the authenticity of agricultural products is increasingly crucial in the global food industry, particularly in the fight against food fraud, which poses significant risks to consumer safety and economic stability. To ascertain this, an extensive multi-elemental analysis (Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, Se, Sr, Ta, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Zn, and Zr) was performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Bean samples originating from Kastoria and Prespes (products with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status) were studied, focusing on the determination of elemental profiles or fingerprints, which are directly related to the geographical origin of the growing area. In this study, we employed a decision tree algorithm to classify Greek “Gigantes Elefantes” beans based on their multi-elemental composition, achieving high performance metrics, including an accuracy of 92.86%, sensitivity of 87.50%, and specificity of 96.88%. These results demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in accurately distinguishing beans from different geographical regions based on their elemental profiles. The trained model accomplished the discrimination of Greek “Gigantes Elefantes” beans from Kastoria and Prespes, with remarkable accuracy, based on their multi-elemental composition. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowing the geographical origins of chili papers produced in specific areas is crucial because the geographical origins of various varieties of chili powder have a significant impact on their quality and price. In this research, for the first time, NIR (near-infrared) spectroscopy was used for the identification and classification of the geographical origin of chili powder of 6 different varieties, combining the method of PCA (principal component analysis) to extract relevant spectral features from the spectral data and segregate visible cluster trends, SIMCA (soft independent modeling of class analogy) statistically based classification model, and the four machine learning (ML) classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were applied for supervised classification. It was found that the SVM classifier, with a C value of 4013.0 and γ of 0.04125, delivered the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.41% and prediction accuracy of 97.22%. The optimization process, guided by a detailed 3D contour plot, led to a model that not only generalized well but also offered remarkable precision, as confirmed by confusion matrices. The classification accuracy of the SIMCA model was 94.04% for the calibration set and 84.74% for the prediction set. The nonlinear SVM technique of classification outperformed the linear SIMCA model and other ML models. In general, the results indicated that chili powder from various geographic origins could be discriminated by the use of NIR spectroscopy combined with the SVM model quickly, nondestructively, and reliably. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - A well-known agricultural product in China, Wuyuan green tea is safeguarded by national geographical indications. In addition, the processed green tea must be free of contaminants like stones and tea stalks. Nevertheless, due to their similar colors, photoelectric sorting and 2D image recognition technologies are unable to distinguish tea stalks from Wuyuan green tea. In order to address the issue of incorrect sorting brought on by similar color matching, this paper uses hyperspectral imaging technology. Using a 400–1000 nm visible and near-infrared camera, green tea with tea stalks was photographed. Furthermore, the hyperspectral image that was gathered was reduced in dimension using principal component analysis. Additionally, tea stalks were successfully identified in hyperspectral images using the convolutional neural network, which can automatically learn the corresponding features and do away with the laborious feature extraction procedure. According to the experiment’s findings, tea stalks can be recog- nized with an accuracy of 98.53%. The technique can meet the real production requirements and has a high recognition rate. The selection rate is as high as 97.05% following field testing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Saffron, obtained by dehydrating the stigmas of the Crocus sativus flower, is a spice of great importance. In saffron, the flower emerges before leaf formation, thanks to the nutritional reserves of the corm. Early knowledge of metabolite levels such as crocins, picrocrocin, safranal, anthocyanins, or kaempferols in flowers serves as a guide to evaluate the quality of the corm (coloring power, flavor, aroma, or antioxidant capacity, among others). In this study, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) was calibrated and validated to determine the main saffron metabolites, both in stigmas and in floral residue. To achieve this, saffron flowers from different locations of the Denomination of Origin (D.O.) “Azafrán de La Mancha” (Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) were analyzed using NIR spectroscopy. Prior to this, samples were analyzed by RP-HPLC-DAD, where the concentration of all cited metabolites was determined. The development of a predictive model through NIR calibration and validation was successful, achieving high R2 values, especially in the case of the sum of crocins and kaempferol-3-O-β-sophoroside. Using these predictive models, it is possible to determine the quality of saffron corm by analyzing the flower. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the increasing consumer interest in wines with a controlled place of origin, PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) and PDO (Protected Designation of Origin), the most acute question is how to identify them. One of the most effective ways to confirm the place of origin of wine in global practice is a comprehensive study of the elemental profile using statistical analysis methods. In the period from 2020 to 2023, 152 grape samples of grapes were collected from various wineries in Crimea and Kuban. The grape must that was obtained from them was fermented in laboratory conditions. The elemental profile was determined in the prepared wines, which included 71 indicators. In the conducted work, it was revealed that wines from Crimea and Kuban differ statistically significantly in the concentration of the elements B, Ca, Cu, Mn, Na, Ni, Re, Si, Sn and U. At the same time, the contents of the elements U, Sn and Re prevail in wines from Crimea, and those of B, Ca, Cu, Mn, Na, Ni and Si prevail in wines from Kuban. At the same time, methods of univariate and multivariate statistics do not allow us to reliably classify wine samples from Crimea and Kuban by their place of origin. In order to reveal the non-linear dependence of the studied indicators in wines on the geographical place of grape growing, the method of a supervised learning Random Forest was used. After training the model on the dataset, the proportion of its correct predictions was 96%. The model used 61 parameters, among which the most important were Ni, Re, Ba, Rb, Na, U, Sb, Zn, Bi, Ag and Ti. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the current era of EU-driven strategies for sustainable local development, the EU Commission has designated the geographical indication (GI) policy as a flagship initiative in 2024. The certification procedure has been simplified, with increased involvement from national and local authorities. This study explores the potential impact of reforms on GIs in Italy, focusing on whether the birthplaces of regional council members receive preferential acknowledgment. Analysing municipal-level data, we employ a Difference in Differences approach and machine learning for counterfactual analysis. Results indicate a higher likelihood of GIs for councillors' birth municipalities, particularly in areas with lower ex-ante institutional quality. These findings underscore the potential consequences of EU reform, warning against political favouritism and inefficient policy management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Food fraud, along with many challenges to the integrity and sustainability, threatens the prosperity of businesses and society as a whole. Tea is the second most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage globally. Challenges to tea authenticity require the development of highly efficient and rapid solutions to improve supply chain transparency. This study has produced an innovative workflow for black tea geographical indications (GI) discrimination based on non-targeted spectroscopic fingerprinting techniques. A total of 360 samples originating from nine GI regions worldwide were analysed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Near Infrared spectroscopy. Machine learning algorithms (k-nearest neighbours and support vector machine models) applied to the test data greatly improved the GI identification achieving 100% accuracy using FTIR. This workflow will provide a low-cost and user-friendly solution for on-site and real-time determination of black tea geographical origin along supply chains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Quality control of flour is essential to control the quality of bread produced from it. We propose a control method based on the morphological characteristics of the granules of starch. The automation of the identification, segmentation and determination of the average size of the granules of starch of each of the cereals that make up a flour, from microscopy images, is an essential procedure for producers who want to produce bread under the protected geographical indication (PGI) ‘Galician Bread’. This identification and counting procedure, if performed manually, is a tedious activity for a trained expert, and is very time consuming. Thus, automating this task would streamline the process, in addition to saving a great deal of time. This paper addresses this problem by using deep learning approaches (Mask R–CNN) to predict the type of the granule of starch and its size for the first time. The trained models are then evaluated with the same raw microscopy images of these granules observed under polarized light, as has been previouly used for manual identification and counting. A dataset comprising 1308 2564 × 1924-pixel images is analysed. The images contain 17000 labelled granules of starch for two types of wheat: commercial wheat flour from ‘Castilla’ (type 0) and the Galician autochthonous flour ‘Caaveiro’ (type 1). The number of samples is approximately the same for each class. Instance segmentation with Mask R–CNN (Model II) achieved valid results for unseen images, with a categorical global accuracy of about 88.6% and with a discrepancy with respect to the areas of the granules as estimated by a human expert of less than 4%. The performance achieved by Mask R–CNN produces a strong correlation between the results of an expert and the results of the network, confirming the practical validity of our proposal. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geographical Indication (GI) agricultural products possess specific geographical origins and high qualities, which require an effective geographical origin traceability method for the important protective trademarks. In this study, authentication models for Changshan camellia oil were developed by fatty acid profiles and one-class classification methods including data-driven soft independent modeling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) and one-class partial least squares (OCPLS), and compared with traditional two-class classification models. The results indicated that the prediction errors of three two-class classification models were 63.8%, 12.1%, and 65.2% for the samples out of targeted geographical origins, respectively. By contrast, the one-class classification models could completely differentiate Changshan from non-Changshan camellia oils, even from the adjacent counties. Moreover, compared with traditional indicators of mineral elements, the model built by fatty acid profiles possessed higher sensitivity and specificity. It also offered a reference strategy for the geographical origin identification of other high-value oils or foods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This research investigates the potential of Geographical Indication (GI) tags and cutting-edge technologies to address this challenge and restore consumer trust. Geographical Indication (GI) is a sign used on products with a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation due to that origin. By utilizing GI tags, e-commerce platforms can give consumers a stronger assurance of product authenticity. However, the effectiveness of GI tags alone is limited without robust verification mechanisms. To bridge this gap, this research proposes the AuthentiQ Market Space, a novel e-commerce platform that integrates smart city technologies to ensure product authenticity. By harnessing the power of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT), AuthentiQ aims to create a transparent and secure marketplace for GI products. Blockchain technology can be employed to create an immutable record of a product's journey from origin to consumer, thereby preventing counterfeiting and ensuring traceability. AI can be utilized to analyse product data, detect anomalies, and authenticate products based on predefined criteria. IoT sensors can be embedded in products to monitor their conditions and location in real time, providing additional layers of verification. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdown have disrupted the farming communities across the planet; however, the indigenous communities such as the Adivasi people of tea garden areas in India have been hit hard. It becomes more crucial when we talk about marginalized communities. In India, the Adivasi tribe found in the sub-Himalayan North Bengal cultivates folk rice that needs immediate energy-efficient measures as the production has been increased after receiving the geographical indication tag. Energy efficiency estimation often applied a two-step data envelopment analysis model in agricultural production. However, in most of the previous articles, the applications discussed the factors affecting energy use efficiency with rare studies on efficiency prediction. In this article, first, data envelopment analysis was used to estimate the energy efficiency of rice growers, and in the second stage, extreme gradient boosting, a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, was employed to derive the key leading efficiency determinants. The findings revealed wide variation among efficient and inefficient rice growers in the first stage and derived the most salient factors predicting energy efficiency in the second stage. The optimal use of energy inputs combined with effective education, better credit delivery mechanism, arable land availability and years of farming experience provided improvement for the future energy use efficiency of the Adivasi farmers. Further, the novel application of extreme gradient boosting as a machine learning algorithm in energy efficiency evaluation suggests decision-making solutions with a prediction accuracy of 80.91%. Moreover, this study aims to assist future researchers in examining and predicting the key leading determinants to affect energy utilization. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present the results from the LDA and kNN techniques, applied to data of Rioja red wines, specifically with Rioja Qualified Denomination of Origin. Principal Component Analysis has been used previously to create a new and smaller set of data, with a smaller number of characteristics to manage, contrast, and interpret these data more easily. From the results of both classifiers, LDA and kNN, we can conclude that they can be useful in the recommendation system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geographical indications (GIs) mitigate information asymmetry in agri-food transactions by providing consumers with origin and quality information. This paper explores the impact of GIs on rural development in China by examining agricultural output and farmers’ income. Utilizing a large county-level dataset and comprehensive official GI information, this study estimates the impact of GIs on agricultural output and rural income using panel-fixed-effects models. The results reveal that GIs significantly boost agricultural added value and rural per capita disposable income. A series of methods, including difference-in-differences, propensity score matching with difference-in-differences, and double machine learning combined with difference-in-differences using random forests verify the robustness of the results. Moreover, by categorizing GIs based on product types, the analysis reveals heterogeneous effects of different GI categories on agricultural growth and income gains for farmers. The research findings in this paper offer valuable insights to inform policymaking aimed at advancing rural development, raising farmers’ incomes, and promoting sustainable agri-food supply chains. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The significance of Geographical Indications (GI) tags in agriculture has been growing. Recently, there has been a notable focus on safeguarding the genuineness and standards of agricultural goods. This research suggests a new method that utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques to distinguish genuine fruits using their images and where they are grown. The system is designed in a way that it can identify the unique features of fruits grown in various areas to verify if a fruit is truly from its original source. To accomplish this, we will develop a strong deep learning model using an extensive dataset of fruit photos and their associated Geographical Indication (GI) tags. The model will be trained to recognize the distinct characteristics of fruits from certain areas and use this information to determine if new fruit images are genuine. We will also investigate incorporating extra data sources like weather and soil conditions to improve the accuracy of the prediction further. The mobile application will host the system, enabling both farmers and consumers to quickly recognize genuine fruits in real-time. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Gastrodia elata Blume (G. elata Bl.), with its excellent nutritional and medicinal value from Zhaotong, has been protected by geographical indication (GI). Accurate certification of its origin is a prerequisite to safeguard consumer interests and maintain the market. Four different regions and three varieties of G. elata Bl. from Zhaotong were used in this study (n = 262). Tri-step infrared spectroscopy was used for ATR-FTIR spectral analysis to filter out fingerprint regions for data fusion with FT-NIR spectra, after which conventional discriminant models (PLS-DA and GS-SVM) were built. The second derivative (SD), multiple scattering correction (MSC), and Savitzky-Golay (SG) preprocessing were also performed on the spectra, and it was found that the preprocessing improved the performance of the PLS-DA model. The optimal model results in GS-SVM, based on mid-level data fusion of principal components (PCs) and latent variables (LVs), with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 1 for the test set. Furthermore, the residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) models were built, based on FT-NIR full spectra, band 3600−2700 cm−1 (MFA) and band 1750−500 cm−1 (MFB). Their accuracy in both train and test sets exceeds 97%, and the loss function curve is close to 0, which indicates that these three bands can be used as a fingerprint area to verify the GI of Zhaotong G. elata Bl. This study provides a fast, non-invasive method for the authentication of food or medicinal plant GI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography–mass (GC–MS) is the most often used technique for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). When coupled with machine-learning algorithms, the two provide the means to differentiate the volatile metabolome of foods from different origins. In this study, the volatile metabolites of winter jujube, a fruit protected by China and the European Union (EU) based on geographical indications (GI), was analyzed by HS-SPME–GC–MS. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was applied, for the first time, to evaluate differences in winter jujube grown in four distinct regions. Locational differences yielded 33 VOCs that differed by functionality and concentration with a recurrence probability of ≥ 60%. Zhanhua winter jujube contained the most abundant VOCs, with Yuncheng winter jujube the least. The 33 winter jujube VOCs were analyzed by random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost to identify the place of origin. The discrimination rates were about 85% using RF, about 93% using SVM, and about 98% with XGBoost. Compared to RF and SVM algorithms, XGBoost was more efficient, producing higher accuracy rates, and providing new opportunities for origin traceability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chrysanthemum is a common medicinal and edible Chinese herbal product, and its growth environment affects its quality and market sale price. So it has high practical value and relevance to establish an efficient, rapid and accurate approach to identify the origin of chrysanthemums. In this study, we collected chrysanthemum samples from six geographical indication (GI) production areas in China and analyzed the four stable isotope ratios (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O, and δ2H) and 44 mineral element signatures of chrysanthemums to classify chrysanthemum. An analysis of variance (ANVOA) indicated that stable isotope ratios and mineral elements differed significantly between origins. The accuracies of the training set and prediction set of the random forest (RF) algorithm were 100% and 98.3%, respectively, while those of the partial least squares discriminant algorithm (PLS-DA) were 96.9% and 96.7%, respectively; the results of the RF algorithm were slightly better than those of the PLS-DA. Combining stable isotopes and mineral elements could enhance the accuracy of origin identification. Moreover, the OPLS-DA (orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis) models for stable isotopes and mineral elements indicated that δ2H, δ18O, Cd, Zn, Mg, Ca, Tm, As, and Tl were the elements that could most effectively distinguish the origins of chrysanthemum, and the discriminant accuracy reached 100%. Therefore, the proposed strategy can offer a simple, rapid, and dependable approach for classifying the geographic origin of chrysanthemums. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geographical indication (GI) offers a unique protection scheme to preserve high-quality agricultural products and support rural sustainability at the territorial level. However, not all the areas with traditional agricultural products are acknowledged with a GI. Quantifying the contribution of each factor to geographical indication agricultural products (GIAPs) can facilitate the formulation of effective policies to improve rural livelihoods. In this study, the random forest (RF) model was applied to investigate the contribution of multi-perspective factors, including nature, society, agriculture and market, on the distribution of GIAPs, and examined the driving causes using interpretable approaches. The empirical findings demonstrate that the RF model is able to accurately capture most of the important factors characterizing GIAPs and to make out-of-sample predictions of the study units which obtain GIs. This study revealed that natural conditions and market demand were contributing aspects to the disparity of GIAPs in Northeast China. The order of determinants was the category of online GIAPs (CatOn) > the number of online GIAPs (NumOn) > the area of black soil (BlaSoil) > the distance to offline stores selling GIAPs (DisOff). Of these, GIAPs was lower than (Formula presented.) in parts of districts of Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces when the area of black soil (BlaSoil) gradually increased. When the category and number of online GIAPs (CatOn and NumOn) were less than 20 and 5, respectively, GIAPs were enhanced, especially for 40% of the districts in Liaoning Province. Deepening understanding of GIAPs helps to better target and tailor sustainable development policies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Strawberry is the most consumed berry fruit worldwide due to its unique aroma and high nutritive value. This fruit is also an important source of phenolic compounds. Changping strawberries are recognized as a national agricultural product of geographical indication (GI) due to their unique flavor. Widely accepted standards for identifying GI strawberries from non-GI strawberries are currently unavailable. This study compared the aroma and phenolic acid composition of GI and non-GI strawberries. Furthermore, the characteristic aroma and phenolic acid markers of GI strawberries were determined. A classification model based on the markers was established using Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA). In this study, six groups of strawberries with variety name of “Hongyan”, including GI strawberries from Changping and non-GI strawberries from Changping, Miyun, Pinggu, Shunyi, and Tongzhou, were collected. A total of 147 volatile substances were discovered using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. The contents of a few compounds principally responsible for the distinctive aroma in GI strawberries were in the top three of the six groups, providing GI strawberries with a generally pleasant fragrance. OPLS–DA identified isoamyl butyrate and trans-2-octen-1-ol as characteristic markers. Enrichment analysis indicated that beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, mitochondrial beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids, fatty acid biosynthesis, and butyrate metabolism played critical roles in volatile compound biosynthesis. The total phenolic content was 24.41–36.46 mg/kg of fresh weight. OPLS–DA results revealed that cinnamic acid could be used as a characteristic phenolic acid marker of GI strawberries. Based on the three characteristic markers, FDA was performed on the different groups, which were then divided. The separation of strawberry samples from different origins using the three characteristic markers was found to be feasible. These findings help effectively understand the aroma and phenolic acid composition of strawberries and contribute to the development of strawberries with a pleasant fragrance and health benefits. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Coffee is widely consumed across the globe. The most sought out varieties are Arabica and Robusta which differ significantly in their aroma and taste. Furthermore, varieties cultivated in different regions are perceived to have distinct characteristics encouraging some producers to adopt the denomination of origin label. These differences arise from variations on metabolite content related to edaphoclimatic conditions and post-harvest management among other factors. Although sensory analysis is still standard for coffee brews, instrumental analysis of the roasted and green beans to assess the quality of the final product has been encouraged. Metabolomic profiling has risen as a promising approach not only for quality purposes but also for geographic origin assignment. Many techniques can be applied for sample analysis: chromatography, mass spectrometry, and NMR have been explored. The data collected is further sorted by multivariate analysis to identify similar characteristics among the samples, reduce dimensionality and/or even propose a model for predictive purposes. This review focuses on the evolution of metabolomic profiling for the geographic origin assessment of roasted and green coffee beans in the last 21 years, the techniques that are usually applied for sample analysis and also the most common approaches for the multivariate analysis of the collected data. The prospect of applying a wide range of analytical techniques is becoming an unbiased approach to determine the origin of different roasted and green coffee beans samples with great correlation. Predictive models worked accurately for the geographic assignment of unknown samples once the variety was known. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The geographical indication of pericarpium citri reticulatae (PCR) is very important in grading the quality and price of PCRs. Therefore, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) technology combined with convolutional neural networks (CNN) was proposed to distinguish PCRs of different origins without damage in this study. The one-dimensional CNN (1D-CNN) model with an accuracy of 82.99% based on spectral data processed with SNV was established. The two-dimensional image features were transformed from unprocessed spectral data using the gramian angular field (GAF), the Markov transition field (MTF) and the recurrence plot (RP), which were used to build a two-dimensional CNN (2D-CNN) model with an accuracy of 78.33%. Further, the CNN models with different fusion methods were developed for fusing spectra data and image data. In addition, the adding spectra and images based on the CNN (Add-CNN) model with an accuracy of 86.17% performed better. Eventually, the Add-CNN model based on ten frequencies extracted using permutation importance (PI) achieved the identification of PCRs from different origins. Overall, the current study would provide a new method for identifying PCRs of different origins, which was expected to be used for the traceability of PCRs products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - 1H NMR spectroscopy was applied to analyse samples of “Swabian–Hall Quality Pork” with protected geographical indication (PGI). To obtain maximum chemical information sample preparation was based on both polar extraction and non-polar extraction. A non-targeted approach was used to analyse the 1H NMR data followed by principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and cross-validation (CV) embedded in a Monte Carlo (MC) resampling approach. A total of 275 raw pork samples were collected in the years 2018 to 2021. The correct prediction rate of “Swabian–Hall Quality Pork” was about 92% on average for both models based on either the polar or non-polar metabolites. In addition, 1H NMR data describing the polar and non-polar metabolites were combined in a classification model to improve the prediction accuracy. By performing a mid-level data fusion, a correct prediction rate of 98% was achieved. Furthermore, spectral regions in the NMR spectra of the polar and non-polar metabolites that are relevant for the classification of the pork samples were identified to describe potential chemical marker compounds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Brandy de Jerez is a unique spirit produced in Southern Spain under Protected Geographical Indication “Brandy de Jerez” (PGI). Two key factors for the production of quality brandies are the original wine spirit and its aging process. They are significantly conditioned by specific variables related to the base wine and the distillation method employed to produce the wine spirit used to obtain a finally aged brandy. This final beverage is therefore strongly influenced by its production process. The chromatographic instrumental fingerprints (obtained by GC FID) of the major volatile fraction of a series of brandies have been examined by applying a chemometric approach based on unsupervised (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis) and supervised pattern recognition tools (partial least squares–discriminant analysis and support vector machine). This approach was able to identify the fermentation conditions of the original wine, the distillation method used to produce the wine spirit, and the aging process as the most influential factors on the volatile profile. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Adulteration is widespread in the herbal and food industry and seriously restricts traditional Chinese medicine development. Accurate identification of geo-authentic herbs ensures drug safety and effectiveness. In this study, 1H NMR combined intelligent “rotation-invariant uniform local binary pattern” identification was implemented for the geographical origin confirmation of geo-authentic Chinese yam (grown in Jiaozuo, Henan province) from Chinese yams grown in other locations. Our results showed that the texture feature of 1H NMR image extracted with rotation-invariant uniform local binary pattern for identification is far superior compared to the original NMR data. Furthermore, data preprocessing is necessary. Moreover, the model combining a feature extraction algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classifier demonstrated good robustness. This approach is advantageous, as it is accurate, rapid, simple, and inexpensive. It is also suitable for the geographical origin traceability of other geographical indication agricultural products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present study, the discrimination of the origin of the traditional brazilian Coalho cheese was investigated by means of peptide profiles using a quick method Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR) compared to Reversed-Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) and associated with different chemometric analysis. Soluble peptides were extracted from Coalho cheeses obtained from four different mesoregions of Bahia, Brazil, from seven different producing factories. 70 samples were collected within 10 days of manufacture and analyzed using RP-HPLC and MIR. The RP-HPLC indicated five markers peptides for cheese differentiation and the MIR revealed spectroscopic profiles of amides with distinct absorptions, varying according to geographic origin. Using the Principal Component Analysis, the MIR correctly discriminated the peptide profiles of the cheeses by origin, presenting distinct groups in three-dimensional space and the Artificial Neural Networks models were efficient in correctly classifying all cheeses in their respective groups of validation, associated with low error rates (RMSEV<inf>RP-HPLC</inf> = 0.0165, RMSEV<inf>MIR</inf> = 0.0488). The results showed that RP-HPLC and MIR discriminated the origin of Coalho cheese and the MIR presented itself as an alternative of lower operational cost, fast, efficient and robust for this investigation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has an important role in digital transformation worldwide, including in Indonesia. AI itself is a simulation of human intelligence that is modeled in machines and programmed to think like humans. At the time AI and the Internet of Things are connected, it can, in principle, act on data without the need for human intervention. AI was originally created by humans as a consequence of the massive digital revolution. Recently, AI has also developed rapidly to perform functions like humans and even produce works of intellectual property like humans, such as creating songs, making new inventions, making industrial designs, and so on. Thus, it is a question whether AI can be qualified as a legal subject of creator, inventor or designer and then register as intellectual property. This research answers this question from the perspective of Indonesian law based on Copyright Law, Patent Law, Industrial Design Law, as well as Trademark Law, and Geographical Indications as the existing Indonesian laws. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Distinguishing the botanical and geographical origin of wine is important to prevent wine adulteration and to determine its quality. The combined use of 1H NMR profiling and chemometrics allows the quantification of 31 common organic components in the NMR spectra of 70 wines from different sources. Using the NMR metabolomics approach, a successful differentiation of wines produced from Bulgarian and international grape varieties is achieved using linear discriminant analysis. Wines produced from typical local grape varieties contain higher average amounts of galacturonic, malic, tartaric, and succinic acid, alanine, choline, several alcohols, and saccharides arabinose, galactose, and sucrose than imported wine assortments. A practical decision tree is proposed for distinguishing 15 different grape varieties based on the amounts of the common wine components. An example of distinction of real from diluted wine via creation of a PLS-DA model is presented. Wines from the two subregions officially recognized by the EU at the Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) level are unequivocally recognized. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Reliable origin certification methods are essential for the protection of high-value genuine medicinal material with designated origins and geographical indication (GI) products. Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata (Fuzi), one well-known traditional Chinese medicine and geographical indication products have remarkable efficacy and wide clinical application, with high demand in domestic and international markets. The efficacy and price of Fuzi from different origins vary, and it is difficult for the general public to accurately identify them through traditional experience. The mass spectrometry detection technology based on the plant metabolomics is tedious and lengthy in test sample preparation, complicated in operation, long in detection time, and low in reproducibility. As a sophisticated, green, fast, and low-loss detection technique, infrared spectroscopy is integrated by machine learning to bring new ways for quality regulation and control of traditional Chinese medicines. An analytical method based on mid-infrared spectroscopy combined with a random forest algorithm was developed to verify the geographical origin of authentic herbs and/or GI products. The method successfully predicted and classified three varieties of Chinese GI Fuzi and four varieties of non-GI Fuzi. In this study, an environment-friendly traceability strategy with fast analysis, low sample loss and high precision was used to provide a new strategy for identifying the origin of Fuzi. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The subject of generations and their differences has been intensely analyzed and debated. Each generation has its own characteristics, regardless of the element that differentiates them. Gen Z’s relationship with tourism has been approached in recent years from various perspectives by many scholars. For the current research, representative characteristics were identified as important for Gen Z: off-the-beaten-path locations and experiences. Off-the-beaten-path locations refer to small-scale destinations, under-tourism, local businesses, sustainability, and local traditions. All of the aspects mentioned before are typical of rural tourism. Experiences are introduced by various elements of rural attractiveness: material cultural heritage (MCH) and immaterial (ICH), the living human treasures program (LHT), wine tourism, products with a protected designation of origin (PDO), products with a protected geographical indication (PGI), culinary diversity, and other rural leisure facilities. Two purposes have been established: to identify the relationship between Gen Z and rural tourism and its components defined by cultural heritage and traditional gastronomy, and to construct a predictive model regarding Gen Z’s behavior when traveling to rural destinations. For this, we performed a quantitative investigation among university students from Romania using an online survey. Using 280 Gen Z respondents from 323 valid responses, we performed a direct logistic regression. The results showed that they value local gastronomy and unique attractions, which we can include in MCH. The price represents an important element when choosing an accommodation unit. Due to the constantly increasing share of Gen Z in the tourism market, destinations and tourism operators will have time to prepare and adapt to new realities. Transversal research will benefit from the opportunity to compare Gen Z’s preferences and changes over time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Coix seed (CS, Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen (Roman.) Stapf) has rich nutrients, including starch, protein and oil. The geographical origin with a protected geographical indication and high levels of nutrient contents ensures the quality of CS, but non-destructive and rapid methods for predicting these quality indicators remain to be explored. This paper proposed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) assisted with the integrated deep learning models of attention mechanism (AM), convolutional neural networks, and long short-term memory. The method achieved the effective wavelengths selection, the highest prediction accuracy for production region discrimination and the lowest mean absolute error and root mean squared error for nutrient contents prediction. Moreover, the wavelengths selected via the AM model were explicable and reliable for predicting the geographical origins and nutrient contents. The proposed combination of HSI with integrated deep learning models has great potential in the quality evaluation of CS. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a method for the protected geographical indication discrimination of Ophiopogon japonicus from Zhejiang and elsewhere using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometrics. A total of 3657 Ophiopogon japonicus samples from five major production areas in China were analyzed by NIR spectroscopy, and divided into 2127 from Zhejiang and 1530 from other areas (‘non-Zhejiang’). Principal component analysis (PCA) was selected to screen outliers and eliminate them. Monte Carlo cross validation (MCCV) was introduced to divide the training set and test set according to a ratio of 3:7. The raw spectra were preprocessed by nine single and partial combination methods such as the standard normal variable (SNV) and derivative, and then modeled by partial least squares regression (PLSR), a support vector machine (SVM), and soft independent modeling of class analogies (SIMCA). The effects of different pretreatment and chemometrics methods on the model are discussed. The results showed that the three pattern recognition methods were effective in geographical origin tracing, and selecting the appropriate preprocessing method could improve the traceability accuracy. The accuracy of PLSR after the standard normal variable was better, with R2 reaching 0.9979, while that of the second derivative was the lowest with an R2 of 0.9656. After the SNV pretreatment, the accuracy of the training set and test set of SVM reached the highest values, which were 99.73% and 98.40%, respectively. The accuracy of SIMCA pretreated with SNV and MSC was the highest for the origin traceability of Ophiopogon japonicus, which could reach 100%. The distance between the two classification models of SIMCA-SNV and SIMCA-MSC is greater than 3, indicating that the SIMCA model has good performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The current study aims to develop a PAN India database of medicinal plants along with their phytochemicals and geographical availability. The database consists of 6959 unique medicinal plants belonging to 348 families which are available across 28 states and 8 union territories of India. The database sources the information on four different sections – traditional knowledge, geographical indications, phytochemicals, and chemoinformatics. The traditional knowledge reports the plant taxonomy with their vernacular names. A total of 27,440 unique phytochemicals associated with these plants were curated from various sources in this study. However, due to the non-availability of general information like IUPAC names, InChI key, etc. from reliable sources, only 22,314 phytochemicals have been currently reported in the database. Various analyses have been performed for the phytochemicals which include analysis of physicochemical and ADMET properties calculated from open-source web servers using in-house python scripts. The phytochemical data set has also been classified based on the class, superclass, and pathways respectively using NPClassifier, a deep learning framework. Additionally, the antiviral potency of the phytochemicals was also predicted using two machine learning models – Random Forest and XGBoost. The database aims to provide accurate and exhaustive data of the traditional practice of medicinal plants in India in a single platform integrating and analyzing the rich customary practices and facilitating the development and identification of plant-based therapeutics for a variety of diseases.

AB  - Sensory attributes of teas are related to their geographical origin and directly affect consumer preference and thus the value of products. In this paper, we propose a portable strategy of identifying five famous green teas with official geographical indications of China using a lab-made electronic nose combined with a quantum neural network (QNN). QNN can be regarded as a modified version of back propagation neural network (BPNN), in which transfer functions are superposed by several sigmoids forming multilevel intervals and can be adjusted during training. Firstly, principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis are used for low-dimensional visualization. Then different QNNs with 2–6 quantum intervals are trained and tested compared with BPNN, support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The results show that averaged classification accuracies of QNNs are higher than that of BPNN, SVM and k-NN, and they raise with increasing of initial quantum intervals but vary a little when quantum intervals exceed 3, and reach highest to 99.38 %, indicating 3 quantum intervals is adequate for this application considering the trade-off between calculating cost and classification accuracy. The results demonstrate that QNN is a promising pattern recognition method for portable electronic noses due to its better generalization ability but simple implementation as a conventional BPNN. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Peking duck, an EU-China mutual geographical indication protected product, is vulnerable to counterfeiting due to its widespread popularity and high profit. Efficient and intelligent breed identification is becoming more and more important to protect interests of stakeholders along the Peking duck supply chain, as well as the reputation of Peking duck. 160 hyperspectral images from Peking duck and Cherry Valley duck breeds are collected and divided into training and verification datasets in a 3:1 ratio after extracting texture features by PCA and GLCM. SVM with polynomial and radial basis kernel functions, as well as BP neural network models are established to identify duck breeds. Results show the SVM model with radial basis kernel function performs the best with an identification accuracy of 94.17%, and further validation achieving a satisfactory identification accuracy of 95%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge management creates value for organizations, allowing them to be more innovative, productive, and competitive if that knowledge is used appropriately. Through this management, vital information is created and disseminated systematically and efficiently, and at the same time, knowledge learning is adopted, transformed, shared, and applied. This research analyzes decision-making for knowledge management in a mature low-tech sector, such as Tequila in Mexico. At the same time, it generates a predictive model of knowledge management that allows innovation in this sector by combining knowledge of modern technologies and ancestral knowledge in manufacturing the product, along with providing support to public policymakers and decision-makers to support small producers and rural communities. The methodological strategy used is an expert system through fuzzy logic, starting from a data set based on the patterns found in a Bayes network. The results show that the most relevant variables in decision-making for knowledge management in the Tequila sector are modern technologies, ancestral knowledge, and the Denomination of Origin. Under the above, it could be inferred that the ancestral knowledge variable is the most influential in achieving high values in managing knowledge management -the output variable preserving the value of a product with a designation of origin. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Banganapalle is one of the most common and popu- lar subspecies of Mango in India and an geographical indication of Indian state Andhra Pradesh. Mango being a senescent type fruits spontaneously goes into the senescent stage within a few days depending upon its harvest time ripeness. In this work, two non-destructive schemes are presented to assess the ripening stage of a Banganapalle mango and to predict the number of days left for it to enter the senescent stage. The first scheme uses electrical equivalent model parameters of Banganapalle mangoes to assess the ripeness. The parameter values are estimated from electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using ZView software. The second scheme directly uses the EIS data after reducing it by principle component analysis (PCA). For both schemes, two different machine learning (ML) classifiers, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN) are used and their performances are compared. It is found that the KNN classifier on PCA-reduced EIS data provides the highest true positive rate (TPR) and Fl score (0.86) in detecting the stage of ripening based on 582 measurements on 28 samples. Proposed techniques are validated using ethylene data for reference. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The growing consumer demand for varietal olive oils of differentiated properties necessitates implementing systematic procedures and tools that serve to detect fraud or alterations. The olive variety is, furthermore, a factor that guarantees and certifies an oil belongs to one of the registered geographical indications established in the European Union. The aim of this work was, by means of deploying artificial neural networks (ANNs), to develop a model that enables monovarietal olive oils to be predicted and identified, using a minimal number of chemical parameters, ensuring highly accurate quality control. To develop the model, we use data from 124 plots in areas assigned to protected designations of origin and quality marks in the region of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). The results are influenced by the different content of the chemical parameters and show that with the analysis of only one parameter (margaroleic acid), the overall accuracy achieved (OAA) is 62.35%, rising to 91.50% when three parameters are included (stearic and oleic acids and concentration of campesterol) and 98.79% with five parameters (palmitic, stearic, linoleic and arachidic acids and concentration of campesterol). The development of the POLIVAR (Prediction of OLIve oil VARieties) model enables some of the most important monovarietal olive oils to be identified, thus being a useful tool to safeguard product quality and consumer interest. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional Chinese fermented shrimp paste is a national geographical indication product with a distinctly regional flavor. The great commercial value and highly appreciated aroma urgently require establishing reliable methods to define the origin of shrimp paste and dissect the aroma essence. Therefore, in this study, flavoromics, chemometrics, and data augmented machine learning were performed to analyze shrimp paste from different regions of Bohai Bay, China. The results showed that shrimp paste contained several volatile compounds, including sulfur-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, aldehydes, and alcohols. In addition, chemometric and flavor association networks indicated that higher salt content produces some volatile compounds, such as 2-heptanone and phenylethanol. Furthermore, the prominent fruitiness and fermented aromas were associated with some key aroma substances, such as (E)-2-octenal and phenylethanol. Finally, a classification model for the origin identification of shrimp paste was developed. The results showed that seven trained machine learning models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were able to accurately (100%) identify the origin of shrimp paste. In summary, this study provides a theoretical support and application basis for identifying the origin and protection of the characteristic geographical flavor of shrimp paste. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Zhejiang Suichang native honey, which is included in the list of China’s National Geographical Indication Agricultural Products Protection Project, is very popular. This study proposes a method of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms to accurately detect low-concentration adulterated Suichang native honey. In this study, the native honey collected by local beekeepers in Suichang was selected for adulteration detection. The spectral data was compressed by Savitzky–Golay smoothing and partial least squares (PLS) in sequence. The PLS features taken for further analysis were selected according to the contribution rate. In this study, three classification modeling methods including support vector machine, probabilistic neural network and convolutional neural network were adopted to correctly classify pure and adulterated honey samples. The total accuracy was 100%, 100% and 99.75% respectively. The research result shows that Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential in accurately detecting adulteration of low-concentration honey. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pu-erh tea, Camellia sinensis is a traditional Chinese tea, one of the black teas, originally produced in China’s Yunnan Province, named after its origin and distribution center in Pu-erh, Yunnan. Yunnan Pu-erh tea is protected by geographical Indication and has unique quality characteristics. It is made from Yunnan large-leaf sun-green tea with specific processing techniques. The quality formation of Pu-erh tea is closely related to the soil’s environmental conditions. In this paper, time-by-time data of the soil environment of tea plantations during the autumn tea harvesting period in Menghai County, Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China, in 2021 were analyzed. Spearman’s correlation analysis was conducted between the inner components of Pu’er tea and the soil environmental factor. The analysis showed that three soil environmental indicators, soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH, were highly significantly correlated. The soil environmental quality evaluation method was proposed based on the selected soil environmental characteristics. Meanwhile, a deep learning model of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network for the soil environmental quality of tea plantation was established according to the proposed method, and the soil environmental quality of tea was classified into four classes. In addition, the paper also compares the constructed models based on BP neural network and random forest to evaluate the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the indicators for comparative analysis. This paper innovatively proposes to introduce the main inclusions of Pu’er tea into the classification and discrimination model of the soil environment in tea plantations, while using machine learning-related algorithms to classify and predict the categories of soil environmental quality, instead of relying solely on statistical data for analysis. This research work makes it possible to quickly and accurately determines the physiological status of tea leaves based on the establishment of a soil environment quality prediction model, which provides effective data for the intelligent management of tea plantations and has the advantage of rapid and low-cost assessment compared with the need to measure the intrinsic quality of Pu-erh tea after harvesting is completed. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Geographical Indications (GIs), as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO)and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), offer a unique protection scheme to preserve high-quality agri-food productions and support sustainable rural development at the territorial level. However, not all the areas with traditional agri-food products are acknowledged with a GI. Examining the Italian wine sector by a geo-referenced database and a machine learning framework, we show that municipalities which obtain a GI within the subsequent 10 year period (2002–2011) can be predicted using a large set of (lagged) municipality-level data (1981–2001). We find that the Random Forest algorithm is the best model to make out-of-sample predictions of municipalities which obtain GIs. Results show that there is a sort of optimal territorial condition characterized by the successful matching of wine-growing profession (vineyards), local actors involved (number of farmers), and physical dimension of farms (middle farms). Being in a vital economic system and the distance from major urban centers also emerges among the main relevant features in predicting the success of GIs. The methodology adopted and the evidence provided lead to policy reflections, in the light of the future Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programming period and the scheduled reform of the GI's quality scheme. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the food industry and consumers, with production gaps, shipping delays, and changes in supply and demand leading to an increased risk of food fraud. Rice has a high probability for adulteration by food fraudsters, being a staple commodity for more than half the global population, making the assessment of geographical origins of rice for authenticity important in terms of protecting businesses and consumers. In this study, we describe ICP-MS elemental profiling coupled with elementomic modelling to identify the geographical indications of Indian, Chinese, and Vietnamese rice. A PLS-DA model exhibited good discrimination (R2 = 0.8393, Q2 = 0.7673, accuracy = 1.0). Data-driven soft independent modelling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) and K-nearest neighbours (K-NN) models have good sensitivity (98%) and specificity (100%). © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is protected by Geographical Indications as harvested roots have different regional characteristics. The aim of this study was to distinguish 95 American ginseng samples from four origins (including America, Canada, Shandong province and the Northeast provinces in China), and to further discriminate samples harvested within the protected designation of origin (PDO) from those harvested in non-PDO regions. Two metabolomic methods were used to acquire qualitative data on the metabolites of American ginseng samples from different origins, namely high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC-MS). There were significant differences in numerous metabolites, including volatile compounds and ginsenosides. American ginsengs from four different regions were discriminated based on 25 volatile compounds and 8 ginsenosides using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which had a 96.8% accuracy and a 74.7% cross validation rate, and random forest (RF) modeling, which reached 100% accuracy using the training set and 92.9% accuracy using the testing set. The same 33 analytes combined with LDA and RF were compared for discrimination of PDO and non-PDO samples. The 100% accuracy was again obtained using the RF model, but only when using data from both HS-GC-MS and HPLC. The result showed that chemical composition combined with chemometric is effectively and accurately to study the origins of American ginseng. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Mislabeling and adulteration are problems in the food industry. Considering the frequent occurrence of safety affairs in agricultural products, it is necessary to establish a traceability system for the quality and safety of agricultural products. The aim of the present study was to establish a rapid detection method for distinguishing rice samples from ten different products of geographical indication in China using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). A support vector machine (SVM) is used to calculate the recognition rate of single spectral lines and multi-spectral lines of the geographic origins of rice. The adjusting spectral weighting of the multi-spectral line composition of mineral metal elements is higher, which can effectively improve the identification rate of the origin of the rice. The results show that the classification accuracies of single spectral line recognition and multi-spectral line recognition are 90.8 and 94.6%, respectively. It can be concluded that the LIBS technique combined with SVM should be a promising tool for rapidly distinguishing different geographic origins of rice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) is an emerging technique in food authenticity and traceability study due to the minimal sample preparation required and short analysis time. Herein, a non-targeted fingerprinting approach using an AMS technique, atmospheric solids analysis probe – mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS), was used to authenticate Chinese oolong teas. In the first part of the study, a total of 38 authentic samples from three main varieties – Guangdong Dancong, Taiwan Dongding, and Anxi Tieguanyin – were analysed and four discriminant analysis models were built using the fingerprint data from ASAP-MS. The principal component analysis-k nearest neighbour (PCA-kNN) model yielded the best classification outcome, where the classification accuracies of the training and validation sets were 100% and 92.6%, respectively. The second part of the study involved detecting possible adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin, which is a high-value oolong tea under the register of protected geographical indication (PGI) of the European Union (EU). Adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin was simulated by blending the authentic samples with 20–80% w/w of low-quality oolong teas. One-class modelling using data-driven soft independent modelling of class analogies (DD-SIMCA), with the Anxi Tieguanyin as the target class, was built using the fingerprint data of the authentic and adulterated samples. An excellent sensitivity of 100% and a high specificity of 98.1% were achieved, indicating that it is possible to detect substitution adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin using ASAP-MS combined with one-class modelling. Overall, findings from this study exemplify the potential of ASAP-MS to be used for rapid, inexpensive, and high throughput classification of Chinese oolong tea varieties and screening for substitution adulteration of Anxi Tieguanyin oolong tea. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For the protection of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) Sunite lamb, PGI Sunite lamb samples and lamb samples from two other banners in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region were distinguished by stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N, δ2H, and δ18O) and two local modeling approaches. In terms of the main characteristics and predictive performance, local modeling was better than global modeling. The accuracies of five local models (LDA, RF, SVM, BPNN, and KNN) obtained by the Adaptive Kennard–Stone algorithm were 91.30%, 95.65%, 91.30%, 100%, and 91.30%, respectively. The accuracies of the five local models obtained by an approach of PCA–Full distance based on DD–SIMCA were 91.30%, 91.30%, 91.30%, 100%, and 95.65%, respectively. The accuracies of the five global models were 91.30%, 91.30%, 91.30%, 100%, and 91.30%, respectively. Stable isotope ratio analysis combined with local modeling can be used as an effective indicator for protecting PGI Sunite lamb. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pu’er tea is a Yunnan geographical indication product, and its brand value ranks first in China. At present, qualitative and quantitative methods with low prediction accuracy are used to predict price. In this paper, based on the current situation and industry characteristics, a differential autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) is used to predict the short-term price. From the perspective of macro and micro, back-propagation neural network model (BP) was established to predict the long-term price based on the weight ranking of 16 factors affecting the price by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution method (TOPSIS). The future price is predicted and analyzed, and then based on the empirical results, suggestions are put forward for the industry in terms of reducing production capacity, increasing consumer demand and combining with the publicity and promotion of Internet. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Honeybush is an indigenous herbal tea highly valued for its aroma, flavour and medicinal properties. It is protected as Geographical Indication (GI) since it is produced from a number of Cyclopia species that are endemic to South Africa. Most commonly used for honeybush tea production are C. intermedia, C. subternata and C. genistoides, differing slightly, but distinctly in flavour. Demand for species-specific honeybush tea instead of mixtures have increased, meriting a strategy for authentication of C. intermedia, C. subternata and C. genistoides. Samples of these three species were analysed, using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the near-infrared spectral range. The data were pre-processed and used for class-modelling, a general approach well suited for authentication purposes. Unfortunately, since the HSI data of Cyclopia species studied are very similar, the classification results obtained with individual class-models are unsatisfactory, e.g., class-models constructed for C. genistoides and C. subternata yielded correct classification rate (CCR) values of 76.4 and 83.1%, respectively. On the other hand, discriminant modelling, which is another type of classification technique, led to good classification outcomes (CCR 98.9%). However, the classical discriminant model cannot be applied for authentication purposes since it always assigns a new sample to one of the classes studied, even if in reality, it belongs to none of them. Counterfeits or non-representative samples would be incorrectly assigned by the discriminant model to one of the authentic classes. Therefore, in this study, a two-step authentication of overlapping classes is proposed, which combines the advantages of class-modelling and discriminant methods. When applied to the authentication of Cyclopia species studied, the two-step approach yielded a CCR of 97.4%, which is a significant improvement compared to results obtained with the individual class-models. The proposed approach is general and can be applied when classes studied are very similar, and individual class-models lead to unsatisfactory results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Panax notoginseng is a valuable herb with geographical indication, and the quality and price of P. notoginseng from different origins are very different. Therefore, this paper proposes a rapid and accurate method for identifying the origins of P. notoginseng by collecting the roots of P. notoginseng. This paper improves the whale optimization algorithm in terms of global convergence and convergence speed, introduces the Levy flight strategy and reconstructed whale synergy factor A, and applies it to the parameter optimization of support vector machines, to obtain a high-performance classification model. The improved whale optimization algorithm model identifies the origin of P. notoginseng by discriminating their terahertz spectra. Compared with the commonly used genetic algorithm and the original whale optimization algorithm, improvement in the whale optimization algorithm was able to avoid falling into local optimum solutions more effectively while having a high convergence rate. Accordingly, the improved whale optimization algorithm optimized support vector machine model obtained an overall accuracy of 98.44%, which was significantly higher than the 95.31% overall accuracy of the genetic algorithm optimized support vector machine model and the 96.88% overall accuracy of the whale optimization algorithm optimized support vector machine model. It was concluded that terahertz spectroscopy together with machine learning would be a promising technique for identifying the origins of P. notoginseng. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Identification of geographical origin is of great importance for protecting the authenticity of valuable agri-food products with designated origins. In this study, a robust and accurate analytical method that could authenticate the geographical origin of Geographical Indication (GI) products was developed. The method was based on elemental profiling using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in combination with machine learning techniques for model building and feature selection. The method successfully predicted and classified six varieties of Chinese GI rice. The elemental profiles of 131 rice samples were determined, and two machine learning algorithms were implemented, support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), together with the feature selection algorithm Relief. Prediction accuracy of 100% was achieved by both Relief-SVM and Relief-RF models, using only four elements (Al, B, Rb, and Na). The methodology and knowledge from this study could be used to develop reliable methods for tracing geographical origins and controlling fraudulent labeling of diverse high-value agri-food products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated the phenolic profiles of Malbec wines made from grapes of 23 parcels distributed in 12 geographical indications (GIs) from Mendoza, Argentina. Wines were elaborated under standardized winemaking conditions over three consecutive vintages (2016–2018). Data discriminated wines from different GIs and parcels, based on an integrative data analysis by chemometric tools. Vintage effect and specific phenolic compounds were associated with some GIs or parcels. As well, regional climate conditions allowed partial discrimination of the GIs (and also some parcels). A random forest analysis correctly identified 11 out of 23 individual parcels across the different vintages. The most notorious compounds associated with such classification were p-coumaric acid, delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, caffeic acid, quercetin and peonidin-3-O-glucoside. The presented research allows to individualize, through phenolic profiles, parcels with unique characteristics over years. This is the first report characterizing Malbec wines coming from several GIs (and individual parcels) in different vintages. These results are strongly related to terroir features of wines, contributing to a better communication to consumers and to position Argentinean wines. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Millet is a primary food for people living in the dry and semi-dry regions and is dispersed within most parts of Europe, Africa, and Asian countries. As part of the European Union (EU) efforts to establish food originality, there is a global need to create Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) and Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) of crops and agricultural products to ensure the integrity of the food supply. In the present work, Visible and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (Vis-NIR) combined with machine learning techniques was used to discriminate 16 millet varieties (n = 480) originating from various regions of China. Five different machine learning algorithms, namely, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Logistic regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM), were used to train the NIR spectra of these millet samples and to assess their discrimination performance. Visible cluster trends were obtained from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the spectral data. Cross-validation was used to optimize the performance of the models. Overall, the F-Score values were as follows: SVM with 99.5%, accompanied by RF with 99.5%, LDA with 99.5%, K-NN with 99.1%, and LR with 98.8%. Both the linear and non-linear algorithms yielded positive results, but the non-linear models appear slightly better. The study revealed that applying Vis-NIR spectroscopy assisted by machine learning technique can be an essential tool for tracing the origins of millet, contributing to a safe authentication method in a quick, relatively cheap, and non-destructive way. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of discriminating monovarietal red wines from Touriga Nacional (TN), Touriga Franca (TF), and Tinta Roriz (TR) from Douro Demarcated Region (DDR) using the anthocyanin profile was investigated in combination with partial least squares – discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), classification and regression trees (CART) and artificial neural networks (ANN). CART and ANN were more accurate in the classification of monovarietal wines according to their origin with a 100% classification rate in the test set. PLS-DA presented an accuracy of 91.4%. The variables most important for monovarietal wines authentication were petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-acetylglucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside for the PLS-DA, petunidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-acetylglucoside, and malvidin-3-acetylglucoside for CART analysis, and malvidin-3-acetylglucoside, petunidin-3-glucoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-coumaroylglucoside and delphinidin-3-glucoside for ANN. The results demonstrate that the anthocyanin profile of Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, and Tinta Roriz Douro Denomination of Origin monovarietal red wines combined with multivariate analysis is an effective tool for verifying their authenticity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The origin traceability of geographical indication rice has always been highly concerned, this paper focused on the perspective of non-equilibrium samples, and the feasibility of using the cyclic voltammetric electrochemical fingerprint of rice to identify the origin of rice was studied. Jiansanjiang, Fangzheng and Xiangshui rice, whose production places were close, were selected, and the fingerprint collection method and data preprocessing method were explored respectively. Fingerprints with rich information, significant features were obtained by fast detection. Principal component analysis combined with support vector machine analysis were used to establish the discrimination model, the recognition accuracy of the prediction set was over 90.0%, showing a good application prospect. The electrochemical fingerprint of the non-equilibrium sample measured by real-time tracking of the reaction process could not only reflect the differences in the types and contents of the sample components, but also show the differences in the chemical properties of the components, providing a new idea for easy and accurate identification of food. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rice origin identification can provide brand protection for rice with geographical indications. Therefore, it is necessary to design a convenient and fast detection method to meet the demands of the market. Based on Raman spectroscopy, this study involved the extraction and classification of characteristic spectral peaks of rice grain samples of the same cultivar but different places of origin. Raman spectra were acquired from 80 samples of rice with four different places of origin (Longjing 31 cultivar), and spectral information was extracted for analysis. First, the rice spectra were pretreated using a baseline correction and range normalization. Second, from the 400−1600cm−1 and 2800−3200cm-1 spectral region starting from the first four principal components of the regression coefficients extracted from principal component analysis (PCA), further screening produced eight spectral peaks characteristic of the place of origin: 476 cm−1, 867 cm−1,940 cm−1, 1121 cm−1, 1342 cm−1, 1384 cm−1, 1462 cm−1, and 2914 cm−1. These were also assigned to functional groups, revealing subtle differences in the nutritional content dependent on place of origin. Third, eight characteristic values extracted by PCA were used to establish a four-layer 8-9-6-4 (input-hidden-hidden-output) back propagation (BP) neural network structure as a rice-origin identification model. Finally, the model was used to train 80 rice samples in place-of-origin classification, and the average prediction accuracy of the cyclic test for the training samples reached 97.5 % after five epochs; for the other four epochs the accuracy ranged from 98.75%–96.25%. These results show that the model is feasible as a tool for the identification of rice types of the same variety and that it can effectively identify rice from different areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The elemental composition of 63 emmer samples produced in three different Italian territories, Monteleone di Spoleto (Umbria), Garfagnana (Tuscany) and National Park Gran Sasso-Laga (Abruzzo) were analyzed by Inductively Couples Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) combined with microwave-assisted digestion. The ICP-OES analytical method was validated to assess accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Recoveries were determined by the analysis of six genuine and six fortified emmer samples spiked at different concentrations. Recoveries (%) varied from 83 to 100% for the minor elements (Ba, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) detected in emmer in the 1−50 μg/g concentration range (acceptable recovery range 80–110%) and from 85 to 98% for the major elements (Ca, K, Mg and P) whose concentration in emmer was within 0.2−5 mg/g (acceptable recovery range 90–107%). The observed LOD and LOQ values ranged from 0.02 to 1.03 μg/g<inf>dry</inf> and from 0.07 to 3.44 μg/g<inf>dry</inf>, respectively, indicating a high sensitivity of the method. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was preliminarily applied to investigate the significance of the detected elements (Ba, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ca, K, Mg and P) as geographical markers. Eventually, Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify the samples according to their geographical origin. In order to validate the classification model, the 63 samples were divided into a training and a test set of 33 and 30 objects, respectively. The graphical investigation of the PLS-DA model highlighted that samples clearly group according to the geographical origin; this outcome is confirmed by the high accuracy achieved. In fact, the predictive model led to a correct classification rate of 100% for all the external samples. The investigation of the biplot and the application of the Variable Importance in Prediction (VIP) analysis indicated that all the elements except Cu contributed to the characterization of the three different geographical classes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and honeybush (Cyclopia species) are popular indigenous herbal teas originating from South Africa. Both are enjoyed for their taste and aroma and more importantly, valued for their medicinal properties such as antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory activity. In the European Union, rooibos and honeybush are protected as Geographical Indications. The Geographical Indication refers to products with unique characteristics that are related to their geographical origin. The authentication of products labelled as GIs is regarded as an issue of food quality and safety. Routine quality control procedures of GIs products prevent their fraud and counterfeiting on the market. However, techniques to determine adulteration or mislabelling of rooibos and honeybush do not exist yet. Therefore, in this study, the authentication of rooibos and honeybush based on their elemental composition was investigated. The methodology presented in this study combines energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) for elemental analysis and a one-class classification approach. Elemental composition of plant material highly depends on soil on which the plant has been grown, but also on some other factors such as, e.g., atmospheric pollution, or plant metabolism. Determination of the elemental composition of the samples by EDXRF is non-destructive and does not require any complex sample preparation. One-class classification methods are well suited for authentication and origin verification problems. Based on the EDXRF data of samples from studied teas, individual class models were constructed for rooibos and honeybush. Several linear and nonlinear classification techniques were tested in order to find the model that handles the authentication task the best. For honeybush tea, the best classification results were obtained with the use of a nonlinear method based on Potential Functions. For rooibos tea, the highest classification outcomes were obtained by nonlinear One Class Partial Least Squares (OC-PLS) and the machine learning technique, Support Vector Domain Description (SVDD). The methodology implemented in the present study has the potential to be successfully applied for routine authentication of honeybush and rooibos teas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Chinese green tea is known for its health-functional properties. There are many green tea categories, which have sub-categories with geographical indications (GTSGI). Several high-quality GTSGI planted in specific areas are labeled as famous GTSGI (FGTSGI) and are expensive. However, the subtle differences between the categories complicate the fine-grained classification of the GTSGI. This study proposes a novel framework consisting of a convolutional neural network backbone (CNN backbone) and a support vector machine classifier (SVM classifier), namely, CNN-SVM for the classification of Maofeng green tea categories (six sub-categories) and Maojian green tea categories (six sub-categories) using electronic nose data. A multi-channel input matrix was constructed for the CNN backbone to extract deep features from different sensor signals. An SVM classifier was employed to improve the classification performance due to its high discrimination ability for small sample sizes. The effectiveness of this framework was verified by comparing it with four other machine learning models (SVM, CNN-Shi, CNN-SVM-Shi, and CNN). The proposed framework had the best performance for classifying the GTSGI and identifying the FGTSGI. The high accuracy and strong robustness of the CNN-SVM show its potential for the fine-grained classification of multiple highly similar teas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Xihu Longjing (XHLJ) tea is one of the most precious teas in China; however, illegal dealers mislabel lower-quality teas as XHLJ tea and introduce them to the market. A rapid, easy, and accurate approach for the detection of the producing area and harvest time is necessary to protect the geographical indication of XHLJ tea as a Chinese product and to maintain market order. In this study, a MOS-based electronic nose (E-nose) was applied to distinguish different qualities of XHLJ tea. A transfer learning method called TrLightGBM (a combination of a transfer component analysis (TCA) strategy and a LightGBM classifier) is proposed to solve the problem of the differences in the distributions of data measured by the E-nose over long intervals, and can improve the classification accuracy of the XHLJ tea. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TrLightGBM model achieved the best performance for the identification of different producing areas and harvest times as compared to five other machine learning models (the support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and backpropagation neural network). The proposed TrLightGBM model can avoid the data re-collection and waste of the E-nose, and is a potential tool to maintain order in the Chinese tea market and promote the practical application of E-nose devices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Different geographical environment has a certain influence on the accumulation of fungi elements and chemical components. However, our knowledge is limited to elucidate the fungi elements in response to heterogeneous environmental and the quality differences among different habitats. Here, multielement analysis, FTIR spectrum, and feature-level fusion technique combined with chemometrics were used to study Wolfiporia cocos from different geographical areas, different sampling sites and different altitude sources. From the results, (1) there is significant difference in element content of samples from different sampling sites and no positive correlation with geographical ranges. (2) There is a correlation between elevation and elements, and relatively low elevation (<1,800 m) is conducive to the enrichment of elements. (3) From the perspective of elements, the W. cocos in Yuxi have relatively better quality. (4) FTIR and feature-level models can well realize origin identification. The SVM models are better than the PLS-DA models, and the feature-level model is better than the single FTIR models. In summary, this study demonstrated that the developed method was reliable and could realize the genuineness evaluation and origin identification of W. cocos. The results have implications for the establishment of the technology system of geographical traceability and the development of high-quality geographical indication products of W. cocos. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The origin traceability of geographical indication rice has always been highly concerned. From the perspective of non-equilibrium samples, this paper investigated the feasibility of electrochemical fingerprint produced by interaction between rice and Belousov-Zhabotinski (B-Z) oscillation system for identification of the geographical origin of rice firstly. Electrochemical fingerprints with abundant information and remarkable characteristics were achieved under the optimum conditions of blank oscillation reaction and reaction after introduction of rice. The recognition accuracy of the model established by support vector machine (SVM) reached 80%. The electrochemical fingerprints of non-equilibrium samples that measured by real-time tracking of the reaction process can not only reflect the difference of the composition and content of the sample, but also show the difference of chemical properties of the component, which provides a new idea for simple and accurate identification of food. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - For Protected Geographical Indication (PGI)-labeled products, such as the dry-cured beef meat “cecina de León”, a sensory analysis is compulsory. However, this is a complex and time-consuming process. This study explores the viability of using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) together with artificial neural networks (ANN) for predicting sensory attributes. Spectra of 50 samples of cecina were recorded and 451 reflectance data were obtained. A feedforward multilayer perceptron ANN with 451 neurons in the input layer, a number of neurons varying between 1 and 30 in the hidden layer, and a single neuron in the output layer were optimized for each sensory parameter. The regression coefficient R squared (RSQ >0.8 except for odor intensity) and mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) values obtained when comparing predicted and reference values showed that it is possible to predict accurately 23 out of 24 sensory parameters. Although only 3 sensory parameters showed significant differences between PGI and non-PGI samples, the optimized ANN architecture applied to NIR spectra achieved the correct classification of the 100% of the samples while the residual mean squares method (RMS-X) allowed 100% of non-PGI samples to be distinguished. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Beijing-you chicken (BJY) is a classic chicken breed originating from the Beijing area. BJY is popular among the local people and faces the risk of counterfeiting in the market. In this study, hyperspectral imaging in tandem with multivariate analyses were employed to identify and authenticate BJY among four common chicken breeds. Images of chicken breasts (50 each) were collected in the near-infrared range (900–1,700 nm) and five pretreatment methods were implemented individually after spectra extraction. Different combinations of pretreatments and grouping methods were used with two statistical classifiers (k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine) before and after feature wavelength selection using successive projections algorithm. Finally, a comparatively satisfactory result was achieved, and the accuracies reached 100% for the calibration set and 92% for the prediction set, in which BJY could almost be identified with a 98% accuracy rate. The results indicated that the hyperspectral imaging technique was a promising method for industrial applications to address fraud in determining chicken breeds. Practical Applications: Beijing-you chicken is a precious breed of chicken in China that has been applied for geographical indication products. The protection of this variety can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the division of geographical indications. Therefore, a fast and effective identification method is needed for the classification of Beijing-you chicken breed. Hyperspectral imaging is a popular method for varieties classification. In our study, the satisfying results revealed that this method could be used for classification of Beijing-you chicken when necessary. The results will be useful for the application of hyperspectral imaging technology in the classification of Beijing-you chicken. Moreover, this method has great potential for real-time online detection in factories for future work. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Pirenaica is the most important autochthonous cattle breed within the Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) beef quality label in the Basque region, in northern Spain. The short tandem repeats (STRs) are powerful markers to elucidate forensic cases and traceability across the agri-food sector. The main objective of the present work was to study the phylogenetic relationships of Pirenaica cattle and other breeds typically raised in the region and provide the minimum number of STR markers for parentage and traceability purposes. The 30-STR panel recommended by the International Society of Animal Genetics-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (ISAG-FAO) was compared against other commercial STR panels. The 30-STR panel showed a combined matching probability of 1.89 × 10−25 and a power of exclusion for duos of 0.99998. However, commercial STR panels showed a limited efficiency for a reliable parentage analysis in Pirenaica, and at least a 21-STR panel is needed to reach a power of exclusion of 0.9999. Machine-learning analysis also demonstrated a 95% accuracy in assignments selecting the markers with the highest F<inf>ST</inf> in Pirenaica individuals. Overall, the present study shows the genetic characterization of Pirenaica and its phylogeny compared with other breeds typically raised in the Basque region. Finally, a 21-STR panel with the highest F<inf>ST</inf> markers is proposed for a confident parentage analysis and high traceability. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Worldwide sustainable development is threatened by current agricultural land change trends, particularly by the increasing rural farmland abandonment and agricultural intensification phenomena. In Mediterranean countries, these processes are affecting especially traditional olive groves with enormous socio-economic costs to rural areas, endangering environmental sustainability and biodiversity. Traditional olive groves abandonment and intensification are clearly related to the reduction of olive oil production income, leading to reduced economic viability. Most promising strategies to boost traditional groves competitiveness-such as olive oil differentiation through adoption of protected denomination of origin labels and development of value-added olive products-rely on knowledge of the olive varieties and its specific properties that confer their uniqueness and authenticity. Given the lack of information about olive varieties on traditional groves, a feasible and inexpensive method of variety identification is required. We analyzed leaf spectral information of ten Portuguese olive varieties with a powerful data-mining approach in order to verify the ability of satellite's hyperspectral sensors to provide an accurate olive variety identification. Our results show that these olive varieties are distinguishable by leaf reflectance information and suggest that even satellite open-source data could be used to map them. Additional advantages of olive varieties mapping were further discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Longjing tea is one of China's protected geographical indication products with high commercial and nutritional value. The geographical origin of Longjing tea is an important factor influencing its commercial and nutritional value. Hyperspectral imaging systems covering the two spectral ranges of 380-1030 nm and 874-1734 nm were used to identify a single tea leaf of Longjing tea from six geographical origins. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on hyperspectral images to form PCA score images. Differences among samples from different geographical origins were visually observed from the PCA score images. Support vector machine (SVM) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models were built using the full spectra at the two spectral ranges. Decent classification performances were obtained at the two spectral ranges, with the overall classification accuracy of the calibration and prediction sets over 84%. Furthermore, prediction maps for geographical origins identification of Longjing tea were obtained by applying the SVM models on the hyperspectral images. The overall results illustrate that hyperspectral imaging at both spectral ranges can be applied to identify the geographical origin of single tea leaves of Longjing tea. This study provides a new, rapid, and non-destructive alternative for Longjing tea geographical origins identification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Olive oil is an essential diet component in all Mediterranean countries having a considerable impact on the local economies, which are producing almost 90% of the world production. Therefore, the quality assessment of olive oil in terms of its acidity and its authentication in terms of PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indications) characterizations are nowadays necessary and of great importance for the market of olive oil and the related economic activities. In the present work, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is used assisted by machine learning algorithms for retrieving of the information contained in the LIBS spectra to provide a simple, reliable, and ultrafast methodology for olive oils classification in terms of the degree of acidity and geographical origin. The combination of LIBS technique with machine learning statistical analysis approaches constitute a very powerful tool for the fast, in-situ and remote quality control of olive oil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, three Spanish wine vinegars have obtained the indication of Protected Denomination of Origin (PDOs) due to their unique characteristics and traditional method of production: “Vinagre de Jerez”, “Vinagre de Condado de Huelva” and “Vinagre de Montilla-Moriles”. These vinegars are expensive due to their high quality, the long aging time and the high cost of production, reason why the adulteration and unfair competition in the vinegar industry are frequent practices. To avoid these frauds, several analytical techniques have been already studied for the characterization and authentication of these high quality vinegars. Nevertheless, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, especially attractive for its simplicity and low cost, has not been previously used to assess PDO or other qualities as type of production or aging, in wine vinegars. For this reason, the potential of UV–vis spectroscopy was investigated for the first time as a rapid and inexpensive methodology for developing classification models to discriminate wine vinegars according to the production method, the PDO and the aging category. Spectra from 70 wine vinegars -including different categories within the 3 PDOs and also vinegars without PDO as known as rapid vinegars-have been analyzed and compared in the selected region of 280–600 nm. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used as exploratory method, while soft independent modelling-class (SIMCA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed for the development of a hierarchical classification model. Differences between categories and PDOs, as well as between PDO and Non-PDO wine vinegars, were observed according to the spectral regions around 300 nm and the visible regions around 500 nm. Furthermore, bootstrap resampling method was employed to generate distributions of classification results and to obtain confidence intervals in the classification. The hierarchical classification results open up the possibility of developing a tool that provides an easy and fast differentiation for the authentication of wine vinegars from different categories and denomination of origins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Spanish red wines from the Canary Islands were categorized into seven classes: Tacoronte-Acentejo (class T), Valle de la Orotava (class O), Ycoden-Daute-Isora (class YDI), Abona (class A), Valle de Güímar (class VG), La Gomera (class G), and La Palma (class P), and 20 samples were studied from each denomination of origin. Metal concentrations (B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Na, Pb, and Zn) and physicochemical parameters (pH, volatile acidity, total acidity, malic acid, acetic acid, reducing sugars, alcohol content, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, and total polyphenols) were used as descriptors to differentiate among classes. Supervised learning pattern recognition procedures were applied. Linear discriminant analysis allowed up to ~80% of correct classification. To improve discriminatory accuracy, another kind of algorithm that can model nonlinear separation among classes was considered: artificial neural networks. This method obtained excellent results, with 100% of the 140 wines correctly placed into the associated seven classes. Our results are in good agreement with the working hypothesis of differentiation among wines coming from different locations, including both different islands and different sites on Tenerife Island. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was selected as a reliable, fast and non-destructive technique to record spectroscopic fingerprints of Moroccan Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) Argan oils. Classification and discrimination according to their five geographical origins (Ait-Baha, Agadir, Essaouira, Tiznit and Taroudant) was performed. A total of 120 PGI Argan oil samples were collected during four harvest seasons between 2011 and 2014.First, several physicochemical parameters were measured, i.e. free acidity, peroxide value, spectrophotometric indices, fatty acid composition, tocopherols and sterols content. Secondly, FTIR fingerprints were recorded for all samples. The data was subjected to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization and to reveal differences between samples. Classification models were developed by Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Mathematical data pre-treatments were applied to improve the performance of the multivariate classification models. The results obtained, based on both the chemical composition and the spectroscopic fingerprints, indicate that PCA plots were able to distinguish the five sample classes. PLS-DA models based on either chemical composition or FTIR spectra gave a good prediction and an accurate discrimination between the samples from different regions. The proposed approach with the FTIR spectra provided reliable results to classify the Moroccan PGI Argan oils from different regions in a rapid, inexpensive way requiring no prior separation procedure. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Balsamic vinegar is a popular food condiment produced from cooked grape must by two successive fermentation (anaerobic and aerobic) processes. Although many studies have been performed to determine the composition of major metabolites, including sugars and aroma compounds, no study has been undertaken yet to characterize the comprehensive metabolite composition of balsamic vinegars. Here, we present the first metabolomics study of commercial balsamic vinegars by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The combination of three GC-MS methods allowed us to detect >1500 features in vinegar samples, of which 123 metabolites were accurately identified, including 25 amino acids, 26 carboxylic acids, 13 sugars and sugar alcohols, four fatty acids, one vitamin, one tripeptide and over 47 aroma compounds. Moreover, we identified for the first time in vinegar five volatile metabolites: acetin, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-acetyl-1-pyroline, 4-anisidine and 1,3-diacetoxypropane. Therefore, we demonstrated the capability of metabolomics for detecting and identifying large number of metabolites and some of them could be used to distinguish vinegar samples based on their origin and potentially quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Synchronous fluorescence (SF) spectra measured at constant wavelength differences from 10 nm to 100 nm in the excitation wavelength range 250-350 nm and pattern-recognition methods were used for searching the natural grouping among Slovak juniper-flavoured spirit drinks. The best result was achieved using SF spectra recorded at a constant wavelength difference of 10 nm. Supervised methods were used to classify samples considering two types of classification criteria: distinguishing between drinks from different producers or distillates of different geographical indications and others. The supervised methods were based on two different data sets: the first principal components of the principal component analysis performed on the SF spectra and the SF spectra. Linear discriminant analysis was applied to the first principal components. General discriminant analysis (GDA), k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) were applied to SF spectra. Regarding different producers, both use of both GDA and SVM resulted in 100% correct classification. Regarding geographical indiciation, 100% correct classification was obtained using GDA. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Identification of fake green tea is performed by sensory assessment which has significant drawbacks in terms of objectivity. In this works, sensory assessment and electronic tongue were utilized for identifying fake green tea. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were used to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of discrimination of electronic tongue. The PCA and HCA revealed a distinct separation between samples, which corresponded with the results of sensory assessment. Artificial Neural Network (ANN), including back propagation neural network with the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm (LMBP) and radial basis function neural network (RBF), were used as an automatic classifier and showed good performance in the training set and the prediction set. The results suggest that electronic tongue can be used for distinguishing fake Dongting Biluochun Tea from certified products characterized by protection of geographical indications product certification with pattern recognition methods instead of sensory assessment. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Being able to assess the quality and level of completeness of data has become indispensable in marine biodiversity research, especially when dealing with large databases that typically compile data from a variety of sources. Very few integrated databases offer quality flags on the level of the individual record, making it hard for users to easily extract the data that are fit for their specific purposes. This article describes the different steps that were developed to analyse the quality and completeness of the distribution records within the European and international Ocean Biogeographic Information Systems (EurOBIS and OBIS). Records are checked on data format, completeness and validity of information, quality and detail of the used taxonomy and geographic indications and whether or not the record is a putative outlier. The corresponding quality control (QC) flags will not only help users with their data selection, they will also help the data management team and the data custodians to identify possible gaps and errors in the submitted data, providing scope to improve data quality. The results of these quality control procedures are as of now available on both the EurOBIS and OBIS databases. Through the Biology portal of the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet Biology), a subset of EurOBIS records - passing a specific combination of these QC steps - is offered to the users. In the future, EMODnet Biology will offer a wide range of filter options through its portal, allowing users to make specific selections themselves. Through Life Watch, users can already upload their own data and check them against a selection of the here described quality control procedures. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The approach presented herein reports the application of a voltammetric electronic tongue (ET), in contrast with a wine tasting sensory panel, as a tool for standardized wine tasting; concretely, to achieve the discrimination of different wine DOs (Denominación de Origen, a mark related to its geographical region and ensuring high-quality levels) and the prediction of the global score assigned by the trained sensory panel. To this aim, a voltammetric array of sensors based on metallic and bulk-modified graphite electrodes was used as the sensing part, while chemometric tools such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used as the qualitative and quantitative modelling tools. Departure information was the set of voltammograms, which were first preprocessed employing fast Fourier transform(FFT), followed by removal of less-significant coefficients employing a stepwise inclusion method and pruning of the inputs. The trend, in global scores, was modelled successfully with a 92.9% of correct identification for the qualitative application, and a correlation coefficient of 0.830 for the quantitative one (with 14 and 20 samples for the external test subsets, respectively). © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a universal tool to investigate the different areas of Earth and environmental sciences. The advancement of the implementation capabilities of the optoelectronic devices which are long-term-tested in the laboratory and the field and are mounted on-board of the remote sensing platforms further improves the capability of instruments to acquire information about the Earth and its resources in global, regional and local scales. With the start of new high-spatial and spectral resolution satellite and aircraft imagery new applications for large-scale mapping and monitoring becomes possible. The integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allows a synergistic processing of the multi-source spatial and spectral data. Here we present the results of a joint project DFNI I01/8 funded by the Bulgarian Science Fund focused on the algorithms of the preprocessing and the processing spectral data by using the methods of the corrections and of the visual and automatic interpretation. The objects of this study are lineaments. The lineaments are basically the line features on the earth's surface which are a sign of the geological structures. The geological lineaments usually appear on the multispectral images like lines or edges or linear shapes which is the result of the color variations of the surface structures. The basic geometry of a line is orientation, length and curve. The detection of the geological lineaments is an important operation in the exploration for mineral deposits, in the investigation of active fault patterns, in the prospecting of water resources, in the protecting people, etc. In this study the integrated approach for the detecting of the lineaments is applied. It combines together the methods of the visual interpretation of various geological and geographical indications in the multispectral satellite images, the application of the spatial analysis in GIS and the automatic processing of the multispectral images by Canny algorithm, Directional Filter and Neural Network. Landsat multispectral images of the Eastern Rhodopes in Bulgaria for carrying out the procedure are used. Canny algorithm for extracting edges represents series of filters (Gaussian, Sobel, etc.) applied to all bands of the image using the free IDL source. Directional Filter is applied to sharpen the image in a specific preferred direction. Another method is the Neural Network algorithm for recognizing lineaments. The lineaments are effectively extracted using different methods of automatic. The results from the above mentioned methods are compared to the results derived from the visual interpretation of satellite images and from the geological map. In conclusion, the rosediagrams of the distribution of the geological lineaments and the maps of their density are completed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The Italian hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivar "Tonda Gentile Trilobata" (TGT) is covered by protected geographical indication "Nocciola Piemonte" and is well-known as the best-suited hazelnut for the industrial transformation into roasted kernel. The hazelnut cultivar identification is primarily based on morphological characteristics, so there is the need for more objective analytical methods for high quality hazelnut authentication. This study reports the 1H NMR fingerprinting of raw and roasted hazelnut, with the aim of obtaining hazelnut classification based on their spectroscopic pattern. 1H NMR analyses were carried out on polar extracts of TGT and other cultivars: the data were analysed with multivariate statistical methods. Results showed that 1H NMR combined with chemometrics is useful to characterise the hazelnuts as a function of the cultivars, both on raw and roasted form. The classification models allowed identifying molecular markers useful to distinguish TGT from other types, among these trigonelline, amino acids and an unidentified orto-disubstituted aromatic compound. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary: A computerised approach to vastly reduce the experimental information required (number of independent variables) to classify similar extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) is presented. It is based on the application of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and further analysis of the obtained results using differential calculations. To validate this new model, it has been applied for the classification of 147 EVOO samples into four similar families. The oil samples employed came from two types of protected denomination of origin (PDO) oils and two non-PDO from the same Spanish province (Granada). This approach results in a new method that reduces the necessary size of the databases used, without an appreciable loss of information, by over 82%. The percentage of misclassifications using less data points is similar to the results achieved using the whole database (less than 0.90%). © 2013 Institute of Food Science and Technology. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper develops a rapid method for discriminating the geographical origins and age of roasted Torreya grandis seeds by near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic analysis and pattern recognition. 337 samples were collected from three main producing areas and produced in the last two years. The objective of geographical origins analysis is to discriminate the seeds from Fengqiao with a protected geographical indication (PGI) from those of another two provinces. Age classification is aimed to detect the old seeds produced in the last year from the freshly produced ones. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was used to develop classification models, and the influence of data preprocessing methods on classification performance was also investigated. Taking second-order derivatives of the raw spectra proves to be the most proper and effective preprocessing method, which can remove baselines and backgrounds and reduce model complexity. With second derivative spectra, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.939 and 0.871 for age discrimination, respectively. Perfect classification was obtained, and both sensitivity and specificity were 1 for discrimination of geographical origins. © 2013 Lu Xu et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this investigation the potential of infrared spectroscopy, coupled to different statistical methods, were used to estimate the authenticity of grated Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) Parmigiano Reggiano cheese (P-R).The feasibility of the analytical approach in the prediction of cheese authenticity without the use of wet chemistry was evaluated. A total of 400 plastic-sealed grated cheese samples classified as: compliance P-R, competitors, non-compliance P-R (defected P-R), and P-R with rind content of >. 18%. PCA was conducted for an explorative spectra analysis. Soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) analysis and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to classify samples, according to different cheese categories. For both the spectroscopic techniques, PCA correctly discriminated compliance P-R from competitors, but not the P-R as a function of the rind percentage and months of ripening. SIMCA analysis accurately classified the compliance and competitors' P-R samples, while samples belonging to the classes of defected P-R and P-R with rind content >. 18% were not accurately classified. ANN was more efficient than SIMCA in the classification of all the cheese classes. The results showed that NIR and MIR combined with different statistical approaches can be suitable for a sensitive, non-destructive, rapid and inexpensive screening of grated P-R cheese authenticity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and chemometric methods were applied to internal quality control of a Chinese green tea, Longjing, with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). A total of 2745 authentic Longjing tea samples of three different grades were analyzed by NIR spectroscopy. To remove the influence of abnormal samples, The Stahel-Donoho estimate (SDE) of outlyingness was used for outlier analysis. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) was then used to classify the grades of tea based on NIR spectra. Different data preprocessing methods, including smoothing, taking second-order derivative (D2) spectra, and standard normal variate (SNV) transformation, were performed to reduce unwanted spectral variations in samples of the same grade before classification models were developed. The results demonstrate that smoothing, taking D2 spectra, and SNV can improve the performance of PLSDA models. With SNV spectra, the model sensitivity was 1.000, 0.955, and 0.924, and the model specificity was 0.979, 0.952, and 0.996 for samples of three grades, respectively. FT-NIR spectrometry and chemometrics can provide a robust and effective tool for rapid internal quality control of Longjing green tea. © 2013 Xian-Shu Fu et al. © 2013 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Parmigiano–Reggiano (PR) cheese is one of the oldest traditional cheeses produced in Europe, and it is still one of the most valuable Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses of Italy. The denomination of origin is extended to the grated cheese when manufactured exclusively from whole Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese wheels that respond to the production standard. The grated cheese must be matured for a period of at least 12 months and characterized by a rind content not over 18%. In this investigation the potential of near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), coupled to different statistical methods, were used to estimate the authenticity of grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese PDO. Cheese samples were classified as: compliance PR, competitors, non-compliance PR (defected PR), and PR with rind content greater then 18%. NIR spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer Vector 22/N (Bruker Optics, Milan, Italy) in the diffuse reflectance mode. Instrument was equipped with a rotating integrating sphere. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted for an explorative spectra analysis, while the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used to classify spectra, according to different cheese categories. Subsequently the rind percentage and month of ripening were estimated by a Partial Least Squares regression (PLS). Score plots of the PCA show a clear separation between compliance PR samples and the rest of the sample was observed. Competitors samples and the defected PR samples were grouped together. The classification performance for all sample classes, obtained by ANN analysis, was higher of 90%, in test set validation. Rind content and month of ripening were predicted by PLS a with a determination coefficient greater then 0.95 (test set). These results showed that the method can be suitable for a fast screening of grated cheese authenticity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - The accelerated growth rate of the human intellect warrants a rapid development of information infrastructural facility protecting their intellectual property. Basically determination of potential Geographical Indication (GI) is a necessity for timely protection of intellectual property of geographical characteristics. The process for registration filling and determination of GI remains manual in most of the nations. Apart from determination of potential candidature of GI and registration of GI, various types of analysis of existing GIs is one of the key issues to be tackled for timely protection of GI. Enhanced growth of communication and information technology, integration of heterogeneous repository of data from the different data sources can be achieved. At the present scenario, the dynamic updating of data, data analysis, data visualisation and data uploading are lacking in most of the information system in GIS environment. For real time integrated Geographical Indications Information monitoring, it is essential to integrate information system with geospatial database. Visualisation of integrated Geographical Indications (GI) information is possible on the desktop environment with the help of GIS technology. But it is not sufficient for updating the data in dynamic environment. It can possible to perform dynamic tasks like update, analysis and visualise of GI information through the mobile devices with the modern high end mobile communication infrastructure. It will make suitable to take the decision at anytime from anywhere in the world. However, the data repositories can be timely updated with the help of common mobile devices from any location. In the present work, a framework has been proposed for the mobile based SDI Model for the better management of Geographical Indications Information Infrastructure with the use of mobile devices by the integration of geospatial database. © 2015 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, information contained in near infrared (NIR) spectra of honeys with protected geographical indication (PGI) "Mel de Galicia" was processed by means of different chemometric techniques to develop an authentication system for this high quality food product. Honey spectra were obtained in a fast and single way, and they were pretreated by means of standard normal variate transformation in order to remove the influence of particle size, scattering and other factors, and prior to their use as input data. As the first step in chemometric study, display techniques such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis were applied in order to demonstrate that the NIR data contained useful information to develop a pattern recognition classification system to authenticate honeys with PGI. The second step consisted in the application of different pattern recognition techniques (such as D-PLS: Discriminant partial least squares regression; SIMCA: Soft independent modelling of class analogy; KNN: K-nearest neighbours; and MLF-NN: Multilayer feedforward neural networks) to derive diverse models for PGI-honey class with the objective of detecting possible falsification of these high-quality honeys. Amongst all the classification chemometric procedures, SIMCA achieved to be the best PGI-model with 93.3% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity. Therefore, the combination of NIR information data with SIMCA developed a single and fast method in order to differentiate between genuine PGI-Galician honey samples and other commercial honey samples from other origins that, due to their lower price, could be used as substrates for falsification of genuine PGI ones. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - In compliance with the European law (EC No. 510/2006), geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs must be protected against mislabelling. This is particularly important for PDO hard cheeses, as Parmigiano Reggiano, that can cost up to the double of the no-PDO competitors.This paper presents two statistical models, based on isotopic and elemental composition, able to trace the origin of cheese also in grated and shredded forms, for which it is not possible to check the logo fire-marked on the rind. One model is able to predict the origin of seven types of European hard cheeses (in a validation step, 236 samples out of 240 are correctly recognised) and the other specifically to discriminate the PDO Parmigiano Reggiano cheese from 9 European and 2 extra-European imitators (260 out of 264 correct classifications). Both models are based on Random Forests. The most significant variables for cheese traceability common in both models are δ 13C, δ 2H, δ 15N, δ 34S and Sr, Cu, Mo, Re, Na, U, Bi, Ni, Fe, Mn, Ga, Se, and Li. These variables are linked not only to geography, but also to cow diet and cheese making processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - Determination of potential Geographical Indication (GI) is a necessity for timely protection of intellectual property of geographical characteristics. The process of determination and its subsequent filling for registration of GI remains manual in most of the developing and least developed nations. The manual process hinders the faster protection mechanism of GIS in a way that encourages bio-piracy. The problem can be solved successfully if the process of determination is fully automated and subsequent filling process is semi-automated (as the nature of information at this stage is mostly semi-structured and unstructured). The process of automation of determining potential GIs require a GIS based decision support system backed up by a distributed database of potential GIs. This paper explores a DSS methodology in the form of an efficient architecture which could be used for potential geographical indication (GI) determination in India. GI is a name or sign used on certain products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities, reputation or characteristics that is essentially attributable to that place of origin. More than 5000 cases/items are considered having potential for acquiring geographical indications, other than 223 already registered ones. The paper evolves round a DSS mechanism implemented through a Geographical Information System. The geographical region under consideration is India. However, with the change of database and rule base of DSS, the system can be employed for any country/region. The system design would get its virtual run through a web portal where the end user/consumer/applicant may get to fill the requisite details as demanded in GI application form. The system will accordingly classify it into one of the 34 classes as prescribed in GI Act, 1999 [1]. The norms for checking the potential are based on the provisions of being a GI such as GI must satisfy the condition of newness as claimed by the association or authority of manufactures/growers of the product having strong geographical flavour of the place where it has been originated/manufactured. Prior registration of GI puts to an end to uniqueness. The sign/word indicating GI must not work against public morality of the Nation. The criteria are checked for declaring a potential GI in GIS. The GIS also generates the skeleton application to be submitted after due manual scrutiny/modification/ editing/addition. The web portal provides a number of services for GI and a user can check potential of getting a GI before entering into time, money and effort consuming process of GI application. The database for such purpose is updated periodically from the application database of GI from IPAB or GI application database of IP India, Chennai. The other database for potential GI is maintained indigenously by GIS web portal. The legal validity of GI will be checked by an expert system that works in conjunction with the knowledge base obtained from the registered database as well as periodical updating of application data base. An architectural diagram represents the total methodology of the project. A test case dry run for a potential GI has been worked out in this paper to show the viability of the methodology for a potential GI candidate, namely "Komal Chaul". The designed DSS methodology will provide a cost effective way for GI registration through GIS web portal. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland. © 2011 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - Tropea red onion (Allium cepa L. var. Tropea) is among the most highly appreciated Italian products. It is cultivated in specific areas of Calabria and, due to its characteristics, was recently awarded with the protected geographical indications (PGI) certification from the European Union. A reliable classification of onion samples in groups corresponding to "Tropea" and "non-Tropea" categories is now available to the producers. This important goal has been achieved through the evaluation of three supervised chemometric approaches. Onion samples with PGI brand (120) and onion samples not cultivated following the production regulations (80) were digested by a closed-vessel microwave oven system. ICP-MS equipped with a dynamic reaction cell was used to determine the concentrations of 25 elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cr, Dy, Eu, Fe, Ga, Gd, Ho, La, Mg, Mn, Na, Nd, Ni, Pr, Rb, Sm, Sr, Tl, Y, and Zn). The multielement fingerprint was processed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (standard and stepwise), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). The cross-validation procedure has shown good results in terms of the prediction ability for all of the chemometric models: standard LDA, 94.0%; stepwise LDA, 94.5%; SIMCA, 95.5%; and BP-ANN, 91.5%. © 2011 American Chemical Society. © 2012 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.; MEDLINE® is the source for the MeSH terms of this document.

AB  - The work presents two approaches for the construction of empirical class-models for a given category C. The attention is centred on the information provided by the sensitivity and specificity, the two usual parameters employed to qualify a class-model. In fact, not only a class-model is built for C but a set of class-models which differ in their sensitivity and specificity. Therefore the range of possible jointly available values is described, allowing the user to select the model that best adapt to specific situations or particular needs.One of the approaches, PLS-CM (Partial Least Squares Class-Modelling), is based on the modelling of the distribution of the values obtained by a PLS model fitted with binary response (belong/do not belong to C). In that way, the corresponding hypothesis test permits the computation of the probabilities α and .βof type I and type II errors when deciding whether a sample belongs to C. These probabilities, expressed as percentages, are 100 minus sensitivity and 100 minus specificity, respectively. The representation of β versus .α is the risk curve that describes the PLS-CM capability of modelling category C.The other approach comes from setting the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, the one that corresponds to simultaneously maximize sensitivity and specificity, which usually behave oppositely. The trading-off solutions (again, different class-models) are computed to be Pareto-optimal solutions, that is, the set of the optimal solutions in at least one of the conflicting objectives, what is known as the Pareto-optimal front, POF.Additionally, a procedure to cross-validate the risk curve and the Pareto-optimal front is proposed for the first time in order to evaluate the prediction ability of both methods.Two case-studies are used to drive the discussion: 1) the characterization of wines that official wine-tasters regarded as compliant ones according to the quality characteristics stated by a Denomination of Origin and 2) The characterization of breast tumours defined as benign (compliant class) from 9 cytological variables.Finally, the performance of the methods is tested using several data sets from the literature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. © 2010 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.

AB  - An automated head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-based sampling procedure, coupled to gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry (GC-ITMS), was developed and employed for fast characterisation of olive oil volatiles. In total, 914 samples were collected, over three production seasons, in north-western Italy-Liguria (n = 210) and other regions-in addition to the rest of Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey (n = 704) with the aim to distinguish, based on analytical (profiling) data, the olive oils labelled as "Ligurian" (protected denomination of origin region, PDO) from all the others ("non-Ligurian"). For the chemometric analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural networks with multilayer perceptrons (ANN-MLP) were tested. Employing LDA, somewhat lower recognition (81.4%) and prediction (61.7%) abilities were obtained. The classification model was significantly improved using ANN-MLP. Under these conditions, the recognition (90.1%) and prediction (81.1%) abilities were achieved. The diagnostic value of the data obtained by one-dimensional GC-ITMS were compared with those generated by two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS), allowing a comprehensive analysis of olive oil volatiles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
